should I get synonyms for rare words?
Remove cardinal tags, except in the format ddd or dddd. How do I convert these into dates?
make a collective graph label for the commentators?
how do i recognize date questions in user queries? (when/what year) - train a classifier? Or
just use spacy trf. compare "what year did i marry" - with sm, year's dep_ is dobj (incorrect), but with trf,
year's dep_ is npadvmod (correct)

PRIORITY

make a gh actions pipeline with eval run
implement graph search

graph entity types:
  PERSON
  GPE
  LOC
  EVENT
  DATE
  keyword (common nouns)

graph use cases:

What did [PERSON] say about [TOPIC]?
What events happened in [terrain type / LOC / GPE]?
In what year ([DATE]) did [event] happen?
What [events / battles] does [person] mention most?
What did the commentators say about [TOPIC]
Is there any mention of [Rare noun] (basic keyword search functionality necessary?)
