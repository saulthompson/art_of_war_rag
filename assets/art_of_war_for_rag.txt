- Behind the simple words, 몬Know the Terrain,몭 there are countless details, and countless people몭s sweat, wisdom and lives

Epilogue: The Conclusion
- The nine essential threads of the thinking behind Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War



Author몭s Preface
I wrote this book because I wanted to give readers real access into every word of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War. This book is my attempt to present it in a new, easy-to-read version.
In this book, you will find real examples from military history illustrating every military principle from Sun Tzu몭 s The Art of War. To help readers fully understand the nuances of how certain military campaigns were fought, some of these examples make multiple appearances in different chapters, each time providing the reader with a different angle. As readers make their way through the book, they will learn about the various concepts, strategies, tactics and ways of thinking that make up the art of war. The reading experience is designed to be like a personal helicopter ride, transporting you to the skies above ancient battlefields, with Sun Tzu himself sitting in the seat next to you, explaining in real time how each side is maneuvering their way through the battle, blow by blow.
My personal background is in entrepreneurship, so some chapters contain brief discussions of lessons for corporate management and entrepreneurial competitiveness mixed in with the primary content. But, these are side-notes to the main historical narrative, and a part of my writing process of following where my thoughts take me. This book is not about looking at 몬corporate warfare몭 through the lens of The Art of War. Rather, it is about really getting to the heart of Sun Tzu몭s masterwork as an ancient text, and understanding what it means in its original context.
This book has been built on the shoulders of generations of Chinese scholars who have continued Sun Tzu몭s life몭s work by writing their own commentaries about The Art of War. Specifically, this book is based on the writings of 11 commentators who have forged a place in history, and whose work was first compiled in a Song dynasty (960-1279 CE) book, Eleven Commentaries on Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War. Each chapter in my book begins with a  brief review of their work, before swiftly delving into a deeper analysis and discussion2.
So, who are 몬The Eleven Commentators?몭 If you want their names, they are Cao Cao, Meng Shi, Li Quan, Gu Lin, Du You, Du Mu, Chen Hao, Wang Xi, Mei Yaochen, He Shi and Zhang Yu.
But who were they, really? The first to write a commentary on Sun Tzu몭s work was Cao Cao, who jotted the following musings about his contribution: 몮I have read many books about war and heard of many military strategies, and of all of these Sun Tzu몭s writings are the most profound. But it would be impossible for ordinary people to grasp the lessons within, and there is much that is superfluous, and so this text is unable to fulfill its purpose in the world. For this reason, I have written a commentary to elucidate its meaning.몯
Cao Cao spent a lifetime on the campaign trail during the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 CE). He is a giant figure in the annals of Chinese history, not only for his peerless military mind but also as a rare talent in the art of governance. Because of his towering historical stature, his commentary has received the most serious attention, and I would assert that his is also the most accurate of all the commentaries. Large parts of this book follow Cao Cao몭s lead. Sadly, Cao Cao was very sparing with his words, and what he did write is succinct to a fault. He even said that Sun Tzu was too wordy! After all, Cao Cao was a professional 멨 a powerful warlord and a poet 멨 and he was not writing for the benefit of ordinary people. As much as we might wish otherwise, he has left us even fewer words than Sun Tzu himself.
About our second commentator, Meng Shi, not much is known regarding his real name, his place of birth, and most other details about his life. We don몭t even know for sure during which dynasty he lived, although it몭s possible he lived during the Liang dynasty of the Southern dynasties (420-589 CE) period. Not much of his commentary is still with us today, but he did leave us some useful material to work with.
Next up, Li Quan lived during the Tang dynasty, probably during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong (846-859 CE). He spent part of his life living as a religious hermit, practicing the Dao on Shaoshi Mountain near the Shaolin monastery. He later was plucked from his humble mountain life, appointed as an administrative assistant to the military commissioner of Jingnan, and later rose to the rank of Censor. He had a lot of opinions and wasn몭t afraid to speak his mind. For instance, he said that Cao Cao몭s commentary was riddled with mistakes, and so he took it upon himself to write a new interpretation. Though I haven몭t managed to find any errors in Cao Cao몭s work, Li Quan몭s commentary is nonetheless very well written.
The commentator Gu Lin lived during the Tang dynasty. During the reign of Emperor Dezong (779-805 CE) he served as an advisor to the military governor of Zhaoyi, a man named Li Baozhen. Li sent Gu Lin to bring a rebellious general, Wang Wujun, back in line, which he successfully did. As a result, he also managed to destroy Zhu Ci, another general who had rebelled and attempted to establish his own dynasty. Gu Lin was rewarded with noble titles: King of Wuwei Commandery, and Commander-General of the Shence Army. So, this commentator was himself a real military man, and perhaps because he was constantly busy fighting, his observations are short and succinct. We can only guess he didn몭t have much time for writing.
Du You is a particularly special character. He served as prime minister of the Imperial court during the middle part of the Tang dynasty, and he lived through the catastrophic An-Shi rebellion that tore China apart. His experiences during this hugely destabilizing conflict inspired him to take up the mission of 몬devising methods to enrich the country and bring peace to the people몭몯 He spent 36 years of his life painstakingly reviewing ancient texts, and the works of generations of respected scholars. He traced the origins of contemporary government institutions, decrees and administrative frameworks, all with the aim of learning the lessons of the past to hold up as a mirror to the problems of his own day. He compiled his research into an encyclopedic tome, known as The Tongdian. Unsurprisingly, Du You몭s commentary is hugely respected and is an authoritative source.
Our next commentator, Du Mu, was Du You몭s grandson, and after Cao he was the most successful and influential of the reviewers. His output contains a large body of writings, many of which reference examples from various historical battles. In this book, I have used Du Mu몭s commentary more than any other. Du Mu was also an extremely famous poet of the Tang dynasty poetic elite, and memorizing his poems is still homework for students across China. Here몭s one of  them:

Raindrops pelt down on Qingming Festival,
On the road, miserable travellers몭 drooping heads

May I ask, where is the wine shop?

The shepherd boy points to Apricot Blossom Village, far, far away.

~

High above in the distance a zigzag stone path
Deep in white clouds, there몭s someone몭s house
I halt my carriage, entranced by evening wind through maple trees
Frost-coated leaves redder than spring flowers

Then there is this Du Mu poem, about his family, which is not so well known:

In the center of the capital city, an old mansion몭s red gate opens
No clutter inside this house, but shelves of books, ten thousand scrolls!
We are a house of two hundred volumes, kept always busy serving Emperors

The line, 몬We are a house of two hundred volumes,몭 is a reference to the 200 scrolls of his grandfather Du You몭s monumental work of scholarship, the Tongdian.
It몭s hard not to be a little arrogant when you몭re the scion of a wealthy noble house, and blessed with an outsized amount of talent on top of that. No matter how brilliantly Du Mu lectures on military theory, his manner can be overbearing. For example, a phrase that features regularly in his commentary is, 몬Cao is mistaken!몭 This is invariably followed by Du Mu몭s own explanation of what he believe was actually happening. 
In any head-to-head comparison between Cao Cao and Du Mu, it would only be natural to trust Cao Cao more. He was, after all, the only one of the two who had actual experience leading troops into battle. But, this doesn몭t mean that Du Mu's different interpretations of things were entirely wrong. Generally, when Du Mu says that Cao Cao몭s wrong about something, the two commentators were talking about different things. Du Mu was a better poet than Cao Cao, who also happened to be a famous poet in his own right. He was certainly very talented, but he couldn몭t necessarily understand what Cao Cao was talking about, since he had no battlefield experience and wasn몭t quite on the same level as Cao Cao academically.
There is a Confucius quotation: 몬Be always respectful, and you will never face humiliation.몭 This idea is also in the Confucian text, The Great Learning: 몮The ruler몭s words going forth contrary to right, will come back to him in the same way3.몯 The idea is that if you bad-mouth someone, someone else will inevitably bad-mouth you. Because Du Mu made a habit of saying that Cao Cao was wrong, another writer naturally went out of his way to tell the world that actually it was Du Mu who was wrong.
That writer was Chen Hao, the next of our 11 commentators. Chen Hao thought that Du Mu had muddied the waters by discrediting Cao Cao at almost every turn, and so he felt compelled to set the account straight. The words 몬Du Mu is wrong, Cao Cao is right몭 appear often in his commentary, part of his attempt to restore order to academic discussion of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War.
Chen Hao lived towards the end of the Tang dynasty, and his views about earlier commentators are summarized in historical records: 몮Chen Hao considered Lord Cao몭s commentary profound and cryptic, while he considered Du Mu몭s commentary broad and sweeping. Chen Hao wrote his commentary in order to moderate the gap between Cao and Du.몯 Chen also respected the commentators who came before him as men of great wisdom, and made it his mission to carry their work forward. His thinking was: Sun Tzu has left us this remarkable book, but it몭s difficult for people to understand it through Cao Cao몭s commentary because it몭s just as brief and technical as the main text itself. On the other hand, he ventured, people might be misled by Du Mu몭s commentary, which although detailed and comprehensive is also undermined by sloppiness and even inaccuracies in some areas. So, Chen Hao decided to build on the foundation left by Cao Cao and Du Mu, and wrote a new commentary.
Chinese historians have grouped together these three commentaries 멪 by Cao Cao, Du Mu and Chen Hao 멪 and given them a name: Commentaries of the Three Masters. By studying them together, students stand to gain deeper insight.
Five of the 11 commentators lived during the Tang dynasty: Li Quan, Gu Lin, Du You, Du Mu and Chen Hao. This high concentration is because China became very unstable during the second half of the Tang dynasty, after the An-Shi rebellion. There was war almost every year, and so scholars were preoccupied with studying military theory much more than usual. This explains why Du Mu, whose grandfather had been a prime minister, became interested in military issues even while he was making a name for himself as a great poet. In this sense, he was very much a product of his times.
After the Tang dynasty, the dynasty most preoccupied with military matters was the Song dynasty. It started with a period of relative peace, but then a series of events put the country under constant military pressure. There was constant tumult, from the Tangut rebellion, started by Li Yuanhao몭s declaration of a rival 몬Western Xia몭 dynasty in the northwest, to conflicts with minority ethnic groups in the north. As problems piled up, the Song court was short on both competent generals and experienced troops. What was to be done? Desperate, the dynasty몭s leaders turned to books in search of answers.
The country devoted itself to studying the art of war, culminating in the government-compiled primer for military studies, called Seven Military Classics. The first of the seven classics was Sun Tzu몭s[bd4] The Art of War, which is how it first became established as a classic text 멪 thanks to the Song government.
Against the backdrop of the Song dynasty몭s military problems, Wang Xi wrote a new commentary. However, details of his life cannot be verified in any detail due to a lack of sources.
Mei Yaochen was another commentator who몭s also known as a great poet, and he was a good friend of Ouyang Xiu, one of China몭s greatest-ever poets. I have used his work often in this book, because his commentary is of a high quality; it is quite succinct and exacting.
Not much is known for sure about the commentator He Shi, not even what his real name is or during which dynasty he lived. We don몭t have much commentary from him either, but what we do have is worth keeping.
Our final commentator is Zhang Yu, who lived during the Southern Song dynasty. His other writings include a book titled, Biographies of One Hundred Generals. He put a great deal of work into his writings, producing a high-quality commentary that I have used a fair amount throughout this book.

~
 
That concludes my introduction of the wise and esteemed 11 commentators of the ancient world. Although they were definitely wise, they and their writings belong to antiquity in many ways. I still had questions that I couldn몭t find a proper explanation for, so I began to search for commentaries by modern writers. There is no shortage of specialist commentaries about Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, but most of them are concerned more with academic research than actual military studies. They are first and foremost works of scholarship, and they aren몭t concerned with war per se. When a writer writes about war, but is not motivated primarily by actual war, he ends up writing in a certain way, and about certain things 멪 sometimes in a way that seems to actually move the discussion further away from the inherent subject matter.
Eventually, I found a book titled, A Translation and Commentary of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War4, written by Guo Huaruo and published by the Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House. 
This writer, Guo Huaruo, was a Lieutenant General in the People몭s Liberation Army (PLA) of China. He graduated from the Whampoa Military Academy and was involved in the Northern Expedition military campaign (1926-1928 CE). He also served as second-in-command of the Nanjing military district, and as the vice-director of the Chinese Academy of Military Science. His commentary on Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War is extremely insightful, and I have used it as a reference guide whenever I몭ve been unsure about something, or when different ancient commentators몭 accounts give contradictory information[bd5].

The highest pursuit in Chinese scholarship is, in the words of Song dynasty Confucian scholar Zhang Zai, 몮To establish one몭s heart for heaven and earth, to establish one몭s life for the people, to uphold the works of past sages, and to bring a peace that lasts for ten thousand generations.몯
I hope that this little book may help you, the reader, and that it may honor and carry forward Sun Tzu몭s work and tradition.

Chapter One of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of war: Calculations

The value system of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War

The very first word of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War is so often misread. The unwitting reader then veers far off course and away from the actual meaning 멪 and it몭s all because of differences in value systems. The word in question is the first word in the title of the first chapter, 몬Ji몭 (?[bd7][TT8]), which is translated as 몬plan,몭 in the chapter title: Calculations.
The[bd9] Chinese word 몬ji몭 has another meaning 멪 몬stratagem몭멪 and also forms part of the title of another ancient Chinese military text, The Thirty-Six Stratagems. Readers often lump Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War and The Thirty-Six Stratagems in the same category. In fact, the two texts have been combined in a single book: Sun Tzu몭s Art of War and The Thirty-Six Stratagems. And yet, they are not at all the same. Both feature this word ji, but in The Thirty-Six Stratagems, it means something like, 몬ingenious strategies,몭 or 몬wily maneuvering.몭 In The Art of War, ji has nothing to do with ingenious strategies; what he meant by ji is 몬making careful calculations.몭
So, what does the word ji being interpreted to mean 몬ingenious strategies몭 have to do with value systems? Well, this question touches upon a very human weakness 멪 the desire to come up with some brilliantly clever strategy that can deliver rapid, definitive results. But this mentality is exactly what Sun Tzu was speaking out against. The Art of War is a book that teaches victory by means of actual, solid strength, not by sneaky stratagems. 
To Sun Tzu, ji (planning) is a fundamental principle, not a specific strategy that a commander can deploy in battle. It is obvious and inelegant rather than ingenious and subtle. It몭s about calculating the balance of power in concrete terms 멪 몬the five factors and seven considerations.몭
The 몬five factors몭 are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and Discipline. The 몬seven considerations몭 are: (1) Which of the two kings is imbued with the Moral Law? (2) Which of the two generals has the most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater consistency both in reward and punishment?
Basically, it몭s about comparing the two sides몭 political situation, timing, geographical conditions, personnel talent, discipline and institutional frameworks. Actually, what Sun Tzu means by ji is the equivalent of the modern-day management studies concept of SWOT, which is used to compare both sides몭 Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat.
But then, what is the objective of 몬Calculations?몭 It몭s all about knowing which side will win. By comparing each side몭s 몬five factors and seven considerations,몭 you can determine before the war has even begun who will win and who will lose, and thus whether or not your side has the formula for success.
The writer Du Mu, in his commentary on The Art of War, offers a clear explanation of the original text:
몮몬Plan몭 멪 that is, to 몬calculate.몭 Someone asks: 몬What does it mean to calculate?몭 Someone else responds: 몬At its core, it refers to the five factors, which are called: The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method; and Discipline.몭 The first thing to do is to go to the temple and calculate the five factors of your own forces and those of your adversary. After having done this, one can determine who will be the victor and who will be the vanquished. When victor and vanquished are determined, then shall you summon the generals and mobilize the people. In the art of war, nothing precedes these five factors. That is why they appear in the first chapter.몯
What we call the 몬formula for success몭 means first calculating who will win and who will lose, and only going to war once victory is already yours. This is the very core of Sun Tzu몭s way of thinking 멪 몬First obtain victory, then go to war.몭 Or, as I like to put it, 몬Win first, fight later.몭
In all of Chinese history, who was the most brilliant and effective strategist? When Chinese people hear the word ji, the first historical figure who comes to mind is Zhuge Liang. When the word ji is used to talk about him, it is in the sense of 몬ingenious strategies,몭 and not referring to the five factors and seven considerations. He would never pass muster if judged by these standards 멪 Sun Tzu몭s standards. He held not a single advantage over his enemy, the state of Wei, in terms of either SWOT analysis or the Moral Law, Heaven, Earth, Commanders, Method or Discipline. But, he had a dream, and so he summoned his generals, mobilized his people, marched out from the mountains of Qi and rapidly stormed onto the central plains. His war brought ruin on the country and the people, and left the fields strewn with corpses. He took huge risks, and the fact that he won involved a generous helping of luck. Yet, despite this, he also had a reputation as the most cautious person alive, someone who never engaged in a battle that he didn몭t have complete control over, and who retreated at the first sign of a problem. This begs the question: why did he feel the need to mobilize his troops and start a war in the first place?
Zhuge Liang몭s 몬strategy몭 was a muddled, sloppy version of the concept ji. So, then, why is Zhuge Liang so famous and beloved by the people of China? The answer is that people love a good story, and he is at the center of a truly great one. Good stories are a common by-product of 몬ingenious strategies.몭
True strategy, and true victory, do not make for good stories. In fact, they usually seem quite dull. This point actually comes up in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: 몮Good fighters have neither a reputation for wisdom nor merit for courage.몯 Zhuge Liang became more renowned for his wisdom than anyone else throughout 5,000 years of Chinese history. Yet, 700 years before Zhuge Liang was born, Sun Tzu said: 몮Good fighters have no reputation for wisdom.몯 In other words, if a man is renowned for his wisdom, he is not a good fighter. When a good fighter does go to war, it몭s a dull event 멪 not at all story-worthy. This is one of the key lessons we have to learn from Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War. Where the layman sees only what is dull and unremarkable, that is where we will find the great way of the masters. That is where we must go to learn the true skills of the greats.


Sun Tzu몭s 몬Reverent Wariness몭
For Sun Tzu, 몬the art of war몭 is not the art of fighting battles, but the art of not fighting battles. It is not the art of winning by fighting battles, but the art of winning without fighting battles. It is not the art of fighting battles first and winning later, but the art of winning first and then fighting battles later.


Extract from the original text:
몮The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence, it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.몯

Analysis:
Sun Tzu made it quite clear that military affairs are of huge national importance 멪 literally a matter of survival and ruin, life and death. Military affairs must be carefully scrutinized, and never taken lightly. Sun Tzu considered this point so fundamental to war that he made sure to address it before anything else, at the start of the first chapter of The Art of War. Like Sun Tzu, Confucius also attached great importance to wariness. In the major Confucian text, The Doctrine of the Mean, while expounding its version of the Dao, heavy emphasis is laid on the idea of 몬caution and fear.몭 This is the idea that one should be cautious and not take risks; that one should be scared of the unknown, and always be alert and constantly scrutinizing not only yourself but also anything you may have overlooked or don몭t know about. 
At this point, I think we몭ve made it pretty clear that the idea of not fighting battles is a major motif in The Art of War. If a leader puts into practice all of Sun Tzu몭s teachings, they will successfully bend their enemy몭s troops into submission, all while never having to fight a battle.
It would be perfectly correct to say that The Art of War is more a study of how not to fight wars than how to fight wars. This partly explains why the only biographical information we have about Sun Tzu몭s life is very vague, while other generals of the same time period, like Wu Zixu, left many a fabulous tale behind.
Consider these words: 몮Good fighters have neither a reputation for wisdom nor merit for courage, but excel in winning easy battles.몯 When Sun Tzu wrote about 몬victory,몭 he meant the kind of victory that is sealed in the temple while plans are being drawn, not the kind that몭s snatched from the enemy on the battlefield. This ideal of victory is, from the start, contemptuous of the kind of stirring war stories that become inspiration for poems and songs. Sun Tzu seeks victory long before battle erupts, a victory in which his troops need never dirty their blades with enemy blood.
Do Sun Tzu몭s warnings about war being 몬a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin몭 only apply to military leaders with armies behind them? Not at all; these words hold meaning for each and every one of us. For example, behind every move in a company몭s business operations, behind every pen-stroke, fortunes hang in the balance, lives could be changed, and reputations made or broken. The pen can be straight or crooked, wielded with truth or falsehood. One false move, and you can be sure it will come back to bite you, even if in the short term there seems to be no ill effect. 
How much life and money could be saved if we all embraced this 몬reverent wariness,몭 and this sense of responsibility, and recognized that every move we make could mean either a new lease on life or abject ruin for ourselves, our families, our companies and clients, and indeed for other people and society at large?
If I have a job, my workplace is an arena. It몭s a place where life and death face off. The way I carry myself through life affects the balance of life and death. This is the wariness and sense of responsibility that I hope every one of us can take into our hearts.

	
Sun Tzu몭s analytic method for strengths and weaknesses: 몬The Five Factors몭

Extract from the original text:
몮The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one몭s deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and Discipline.몯

Analysis:
I have already mentioned that the concept of ji (plans) in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War is the way of calculating the balance of strengths and weakness between one몭s own forces and the enemy. As noted, it몭s in fact very similar to the SWOT analytic model used today in corporate strategy to calculate strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats.
Now, let몭s talk about how the balance of the five factors is calculated: The Moral Law, Heaven, Earth, the Commander, and Method and Discipline.
The 몬Moral Law몭 (the Dao) is about the ruler몭s ability to obtain the compliance of the people, which is achieved by winning their trust through demonstrating grace. Basically, it몭s about whether the people do what you tell them to do. It몭s about whether your ruler is an enlightened lord who possesses the Moral Law, or a crass despot to whom such a thing is a foreign concept. The Moral Law is about comparing each side몭s political situation, and the leadership ability of each side몭s ruler.
몬Heaven몭 and 몬Earth몭 form a pair. Heaven is about following the timing of nature (몬heaven몭), and Earth is about having knowledge of the lay of the land. Even if the way you carry out a mission is the same regardless of when you do it, you still have to consider the timing. If the timing is right, success will follow. But if the timing is wrong, nothing you can do will make it work.
Once you have compared the idiosyncrasies of each side몭s ruler, the natural timing, and the advantageousness of the terrain, it is time to compare 몬the Commander.몭 Whose general is more skillful? This is about appointing someone who is wise, competent and even-handed: a sage. This is why moles are often used during war 멪 agents who are sent to bribe the enemy ruler몭s most trusted advisors and ministers. This is the 몬stratagem of sowing discord.몭 Your agent infiltrates the enemy court and feeds the ruler incriminating information about his most capable generals. The aim is for him  to call these generals back to court and away from the front lines, and then send out some moron in their place. It몭s then that you strike.
Finally, we compare 몬Method and Discipline몭 (discipline is normally translated as 몬law몭). This has nothing to do with a country몭s politics, which is about the Moral Law, or the Dao, more than anything else. 몬Method and Discipline몭 are about military law.
The commentator Wang Xi wrote, 몮The art of war is governed by five factors. The Dao of using military force is about harmonious inter-personal relations (this is the most fundamental) and natural timing and favourable terrain (this is auxiliary).몯 One should only raise an army when all three of these factors have been achieved. Once you몭ve decided to raise an army, you have to choose your generals and your commander-in-chief. Once the commander-in-chief has been selected, it몭s time to drill method and discipline. The commander-in-chief must have strong abilities in leadership, formulating clear and strict rules and orders, and ensuring strict obedience.
That wraps up our explanation of the order of the five factors: first the 몬Moral Law,몭 then 몬Heaven,몭 followed by 몬Earth,몭 몬the Commander,몭 and finally 몬Method and Discipline.몭
The commentator Zhang Yu also makes a point of explaining the order of the five factors. He said the reason 몬the Commander몭 and 몬Method and Discipline몭 are put in last place is that whenever a ruler decides to raise an army to attack some neighboring despot, the first thing to be done, when you몭re planning in the temple, is to analyze how much loyalty each side몭s ruler inspires in their people. Are they are willing to die for him? The next step is to gauge the natural timing: whether going to war would be in keeping with the timing or in conflict with it. Then, the terrain must be analyzed 멪 is it easy or treacherous? When these three factors are in place, it몭s time to send your general out into the field. Once your troops have crossed the border and left your country, 몬Method and Discipline몭 are entirely in the hands of your commander.
That is why the five factors are put in this order. They are used in sequence to calculate and compare each side몭s strengths and weaknesses, and to form a picture of the prospects of victory or defeat.


Victory belongs to the side that is united in desire, from the highest general to the lowest soldier
	
Extract from the original text:
몮The Moral Law (Dao) causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.몯

Analysis:
Sun Tzu몭s interpretation of the Dao is very clear. It is the 몬Moral Law몭 멪 the ability to make the people of one mind with their ruler, and the soldiers of one mind with their general. The winning side will be the one that can achieve this.
When the people and the leaders are united, share common moral values and have the same desires, the country has the internal foundation for waging war. This boils down to whether or not the people support the war effort. You should only fight if the whole country supports you. If you don몭t have unanimous support, you shouldn몭t make any rash moves.
This should not be confused with the righteousness of any given war; that is not what Sun Tzu is talking about. He is concerned with a different question: do the people support the war? Japan몭s pre-Second World War invasion of China is a good example. If the Dao was about having a righteous cause, then of course Japan did not have the Dao. However, that몭s not the answer you get if you look at it in terms of whether 몭the people are in complete accord with their ruler.몭 Japanese militaristic propaganda had already whipped the country into wild enthusiasm for war. The conditions existed where 몬they will follow their ruler regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.몭 For the Japanese people, whether they lived or died did not even enter into the equation, with the most extreme example being the suicidal kamikaze fighter pilots.
If you look at China during the Japanese invasion and occupation (1937-1945 CE), it was not a unified state. There was constant fighting between regional warlords, on top of which, the Nationalist Party and the Communist Party were engaged in a civil war. The common people yearned for peace. They had no appetite for war, nor did they have a unifying Emperor who could inspire universal loyalty. China was on the losing side of the Japanese invasion for eight years, and lost at the very first of the five factors 멪 Moral Law, which compels people to be 몬in complete accord with their ruler.몭
The Dao, as it is interpreted by military men, is not about cosmic truths. To them, it몭s a simple question of whether the people support your war or not. Are they loyal to the ruler, or aren몭t they? Are they willing to lay down their life for their country? It몭s irrelevant whether the war is 몬just몭 or not. Anyone who goes to war will claim that they are on the right side. So, how do we know who is on the side of good? We can only even begin to see who 몬the good guys몭 were several years, or perhaps a decade or more, after the war has ended. After that, it takes many decades, or a century, before there is any kind of unanimous verdict. If you want to use the Dao to win a war, the key is to get three things right: policy, publicity (propaganda) and the mind-set of your troops. If you can do that, people will willingly fight by your side.
If you make the Dao your first priority, you understand that in war, the state몭s propaganda machine is just as important as its war machine. One could argue that몭s it몭s even more important. The Mao-era army leader, Lin Biao, realized the truth of this when he said that anyone attempting to seize power must rely on two barrels: the barrel of the gun, and the barrel of the pen. These same two barrels also are vital tools for solidifying power.
Some historians in the field of communications studies consider Sun Tzu the first thinker to write about propaganda, and indeed the origins of communications studies lie in military propaganda. Propaganda Technique in the World War, a book written after the First World War by American political scientist Harold Lasswell, became one of the seminal works of communications studies, and many of its ideas are identical to those of Sun Tzu.




Heavenly Timing: Military uses of meteorology
	
Extract from the original text:
몮Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.몯

Analysis:
Cao Cao commented on this passage: 몮When launching an attack, conform with Heaven on the basis of Yin and Yang and the four seasons. Hence, it is written in The Methods of the Sima (another of the Seven Military Classics, written by Sima Rangju): 몬One does not mobilize troops in winter or summer; this is how one extends love toward the people.몭몯
But, did Cao Cao stick to his own rules? Not at all. In fact, he suffered a famous defeat precisely because he didn몭t heed his own words 멪 the Battle of Redcliff. Before the battle, his adversaries Zhou Yu and Sun Quan had essentially carried out a SWOT analysis. They wrote: 몮Now is a time of great cold; the horses have no grass to eat, and Cao몭s troops have travelled far from the Chinese heartland; they are unfamiliar with the conditions in the south and are not yet acclimatized, so they are vulnerable to infectious illnesses; this is not the way one should handle one몭s army.몯
Yin and Yang, cold and heat, and the four seasons are a progressive series of concepts. Heaven is made up of two kinds of qi, Yin and Yang. When one expands, the other contracts, and it is this fluctuating dynamic that gives rise to cold and heat. The changing balance of cold and heat is marked by the four seasons.
In fact, in military discussions there are three layers of meaning within 몬Heaven몭:
1) The grand scheme of things in the world at large (몬all under heaven몭). This is about conducting one몭s worldly business in a way that conforms with Heaven.
2) Observing the stars, the clouds, and qi; burning turtle shells and divining the meaning in the cracks that form.
3) The four seasons; weather forecasting and using weather conditions to one몭s advantage in war.
The first point is about the macro-level situation and grand strategies. Questions relating to this point are worked out long before raising an army.
In discussions of the third point, strategists such as Wu Qi in his Warring States-era (475-221 BCE) book, The Wuzi, analyze weather conditions using a standard set of terms. These include 몬strong winds,몭 몬time of great cold,몭 몬midsummer몭 and 몬blistering heat.몭 Different decisions are made depending on the benefits or dangers of the conditions at hand. Weather can even be used as a weapon. For example, if you plan to use fire against your enemy, you몭ll need to rely upon the wind, which essentially means relying on 몬Heaven.몭
Of all three of the aspects of 몬Heaven,몭 the second one is the most talked about: divination. However, talking about it is precisely the key; it is about making sure everyone hears what you are saying. Basically, it몭s a kind of propaganda 멪 a useful kind of nonsense that몭s used to fool one몭s enemies 멪 but which one should never actually believe in. The famous military leader, Lord Jiang, who advised the first king of the Zhou dynasty, expressed it like this: 몮A wise man does not personally follow such things, though fools preoccupy themselves with them.몯
When Zhou Wu, who was to become the first King of Zhou, launched his attack on the tyrant king of the Shang dynasty, his troops were deployed for battle at Gongtou Mountain in Sishui. The weather that day was foul, with wild winds, torrential downpours, and thunder and lightning. The wind ripped the troops몭 battle flags and drums to shreds, and as Zhou Wu stood on his war chariot, his bodyguards were scared stupid.
Faced with this situation, Lord Jiang said: 몮In war, it is not necessarily always auspicious to conform with Heaven and the Dao, and likewise it is not always inauspicious to turn against them. However, if you lose control of events and of people, your whole army will be destroyed and you will be lost. As for ghosts and gods, Heaven and the Dao, these are things that cannot be seen, cannot be heard. Therefore, a wise man does not concern himself with such things, while fools allow themselves to be constrained by them. Here, today, you have capable and worthy men. The time to make your move and gain victory is not determined by the auspiciousness of the date, but by the favourableness of events; not by readings of yarrow stalks, but by the auspiciousness of the actual situation. Do not wait and pray, and blessings will follow.몯
Imediately after Lord Jiang said this, he gave the order to attack. Zhou Wu, the king-to-be, protested: 몮If we attack now we will be going against the god Taisui! The turtle shell readings are not propitious, the readings from the yarrow stalks are inauspicious, and the stars spell disaster! Please withdraw the troops.몯
Lord Jiang was infuriated, and said to Zhou Wu: 몮In our time, the Shang king has executed the sage Bi Gan, imprisoned the sage Qizi, and rules the land with the evil minister Fei Lian. Why should we not overthrow him?몯
Lord Jiang then said that the yarrow stalks and turtle shells used in divination were nothing but 몮dead, dry grass and moldy old bones.몯 He ordered one of his men to bring the stalks and shells to him, and had them burned. Then, he personally led his men into battle. Zhou Wu followed his lead, and on that day, their enemy 멪 the Shang king 멪 was destroyed.
In another example, Liu Yu, founder of the Song of the Southern dynasties, was advancing upon the city of Guanggu, having managed to surround the forces of the non-Chinese Murong people. He was about to give the order to attack when his generals decided to consult a calendar. They realized that it was an inauspicious day: 몬The day of moving toward destruction.몭 Each of the generals in turn insisted in no uncertain terms that they could not make any moves. But, Liu Yu said to them: 몮Huh! Moving toward destruction멞 this is very auspicious! I will be moving towards their destruction!몯 Liu Yu did indeed take the city of Guanggu on that day.
There is a popular Chinese saying to express the idea of 몬when the time is right.몭 It translates as: 몬When the Heavenly timing is good, when the land is favourable, and when the people are in harmony.몭 Here, we have seen that 몬Heavenly timing몭 is actually about people being in harmony 멪  all people under heaven being in harmony, not just one몭s own people.
For military men, the concept of 몬Heaven몭 is just military meteorology. It all boils down to things like reading the stars, the clouds and qi. Making divinations from yarrow stalks and burning turtle shells are just a part of propaganda. People who were in power, and who really controlled military situations, never actually believed in such superstitious things.




When on the march, you must move through uninhabited areas; the Enemy should be engaged in favourable terrain

Extract from the original text:
몮Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.몯

Analysis:
Cao Cao wrote in his commentary: 몮Here, Sun Tzu is speaking about the nine different kinds of terrain, and their favourableness in different seasons. For a discussion of this, refer to the chapter entitled The Nine Situations.몯
The Nine Situations is found near the end of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, and it contains a detailed analysis of the features and uses of nine distinct types of terrain. Hence, the discussion of terrain in this part of the book is rather brief.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Whenever troops are to be used, it is valuable to first know the lay of the land. When you are familiar with the distances, you can use the stratagem of directness and indirectness.몯 You can know whether to take a direct route or a meandering one. When you know how difficult or easy the terrain is to traverse, you know where foot soldiers and cavalry have unique advantages, and thus where to deploy them. 몮When you know the locations of open ground and narrow passes, then you can gauge how many or how few soldiers you can use.몯 You can know where to spread your troops out, and where a bottleneck can be defended by a single man. 몮When you know the chances of death and life in various positions, then you can identify the positions that are amenable to fighting and to retreating.몯 For example, if you deploy soldiers in a position where there is a high 몬chance of death,몭 you know there will definitely be heavy fighting in this position. Conversely, if you deploy them in a position with a high 몬chance of life,몭 it will be easy to retreat and disperse.
Of all the generals of the early People몭s Liberation Army, the most capable was Su Yu. Among his admirers was Lin Biao, who said that Su was like a god of war, always descending upon his enemy from the sky. So, what were the bedrocks of Su몭s battle craft? Two things: maps and marching. Using maps, he would learn battlefield terrain by heart, and apparently would use maps so heavily that they were worn down into scraps of paper.
Marching and moving one몭s troops is a crucial part of fighting battles 멪 perhaps even more important than directly engaging the enemy. People often think that a battle has only really started once guns are being fired, but in reality, by the time that몭s happening the winner and loser have already been decided. And, crucially, they have been decided by troop movement: bringing soldiers into battle in the right place, at the right time, and with the right level of force. 	
This is known as 몬mobile warfare.몭 So, when people say that Su Yu was the most capable PLA commander, what they몭re really saying is that he was the most capable mover of troops. He invested more work and nuance than anyone else in studying and making use of terrain. During the Huaihai campaign of 1948-1949, Su Yu몭s troops were constantly moving around the war zone. They followed the principles of moving only through places where there were no other people, and engaging the enemy only when he enjoyed the advantages of favourable terrain and superior firepower. Fighting in this way, Su Yu was able to split a single army unit into ten mobile strike forces. He was like a master butcher, blades dancing everywhere, appearing and disappearing at will, like a ghost, and descending upon the enemy as if from the sky.
Along with troop movement, camping is also an important part of fighting wars. Campsites must be chosen on the basis of one몭s battle plan, and this is not only a matter of terrain but also of troop morale and battle effectiveness. Napoleon famously said that no matter how heavy the losses an army suffers in battle, it still does not have as negative an impact on the army as an unhygienic campsite.
We can see now that most of the work that determines a battle몭s outcome has nothing to do with what we hear about in the epic stories and the songs. The important parts happen well before the two sides engage 멪 by then, all that몭s left to do is watch the pre-determined result unfold. Isn몭t it the same in our day-to-day lives, in the world of work?




Be mindful of other people몭s interests, and make sure they know
	
Extract from the original text:
몮The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.몯

Analysis:
Here, Sun Tzu tells us the order of importance of different personality traits that 몬The Commander몭 must possess. This is another case where his value system shows through 멪 he put 몬wisdom몭 in first place, whereas 몬courage몭 is relegated to fourth. Sun Tzu emphasizes wisdom because he wants to win before committing to battle, or even without fighting at all, rather than strong-arming the enemy몭s troops into submission by force. There is a Chinese four-character saying5 that translates as: 몬A man who is both wise and courageous.몭 Yet, Sun Tzu has split these two virtues apart, and put 몬sincerity몭 and 몬benevolence몭 between them. What should we make of this? 	
First of all, what exactly is 몬wisdom?몭
Du Mu wrote in his commentary: 몮The Dao of the ancient kings was predicated above all else upon benevolence. Meanwhile, among military commanders it is prevalent to prioritize the use of wisdom.몯 With wisdom, a commander can identify shifts in political currents and be agile enough to react effectively.
Shen Baoxu, who was a senior official during the Warring States era (475-221 BCE), said: 몮Without wisdom, one cannot have knowledge of the people몭s limits, and one is unable to gauge the number of people in the world.몯 Wisdom underpins the ability to understand the limits of one몭s own strength, the balance of power and the overall situation in the world, as well as the ability to plan properly and to adapt to changing circumstances on the battlefield.
That being said, it몭s not quite as simple as putting wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness in order. None of these virtues can exist independently of each other; if you have one, you must have them all.
Now, let몭s look at what our commentators have to say about this passage. Only three of them wrote about it.
Gu said: 몮With wisdom alone, man becomes treacherous; if a man showers benevolence on all without discrimination, he becomes weak; if a man is obstinately sincere, then he is a fool; if man knows only courage and force, then he becomes brutal; if a man is too strict when he gives commands, then he becomes cruel. The only way to become a worthy Commander is to possess all five of these qualities and to use each only when appropriate.몯
Mei Yaochen said: 몮With wisdom, a man can formulate plans; with sincerity, a man can hand out both rewards and punishments; with benevolence, a man can maintain closeness with the people; with courage, a man can make decisions resolutely; with strictness, a man can establish his power.몯
Wang Xi said: 몮The wise man looks first, and feels no doubts, but is able to reflect, plan, and fully understand changes in the currents of politics; the sincere man is consistent in what he says and in the orders he gives to subordinates; the benevolent man is devoted to compassion, and thus gains people몭s hearts; the brave man defends what is right and has no fear, and is decisive and resolute; the strict man uses his prestige to rectify the hearts of the masses. These five qualities all need each other; not a single one may be lacking.몯
Next, what is 몬sincerity?몭
Du Mu gives an accurate answer: 몮Sincerity means making clear criteria for rewards and punishments so that everyone is extremely clear about what punishment they can expect for each kind of violation and what reward they can expect for each kind of meritorious deed.몯
For the kingdom of Qin, the first to rise above the other warring Chinese states and form an all-China empire, 몬sincerity몭 was the key that unlocked the destruction of its six rival kingdoms. The Qin leaders몭 sincerity was not directed toward its rivals, but toward the armies and common people of the Qin kingdom. Particularly noteworthy was the mechanism by which deserving subjects were granted titles within the nobility, which was completely tied to military merit. A good example is the old Chinese word shouji (솤?[bd10]): shou means 몬a person몭s head,몭 ji means 몬grade/rank,몭 and together shouji means 몬a severed head.몭 The word comes from the Qin convention of elevating a person by one grade within the hierarchy of nobility each time they cut off an enemy몭s head! This was a way of implanting the codes of reward and punishment into the very language people spoke 멪 a person몭s head no longer just meant 몬a person몭s head,몭 but 몬one rank higher in the nobility.몭 The people of Qin were brave and eager to be at the front of the charge 멪 who wouldn몭t be with such rewards waiting to be claimed?
When the pioneering Qin minister, Lord Shang Yang, instituted a series of reforms, the first thing he did was establish a reputation for sincerity. He did this by planting a wooden pole in the ground by the south gate of the capital city. He stuck a notice on the pole, which said that whoever took the pole and carried it to the north gate would be awarded ten taels of gold. No one actually believed the notice. So, a new notice was written, raising the award to 50 taels of gold! This was enough for someone to give it a try, and sure enough, the man got his 50 taels of gold. From then on, the people believed whatever the government said.
Sincerity 멪 with it, the people몭s hearts and muscles are at your disposal; without it, the people몭s hearts and muscles are not yours to use.
There is another type of sincerity beyond just clear criteria for rewards and punishments, and that is 몬unspoken sincerity.몭 Only kings and the highest-ranking generals have total power to set rewards and punishments, but lower-ranked commanders still need to be able to lead troops into battle. Addressing this need, The United States Military Academy (also known as 몬West Point,몭) makes a specific demand of its students, and it몭s about leadership skills: Always be mindful of other people몭s interests, and make sure they are aware that you are doing so.
Sincerity is not just an administrative mechanism; more importantly, it is also a personal force that people can exert on others. Fundamental to this side of sincerity is the ability to include other people in your considerations. Without doing this, you cannot hope to truly have sincerity. The second most fundamental thing is the ability to make other people aware that they are a factor in our thinking. Otherwise, even if you are mindful of other people몭s interests, they won몭t know that and aren몭t likely to stick around at your side for long.
Next on the list of five virtues is 몬benevolence.몭
Du Mu comments: 몮The benevolent man loves the people and cherishes objects, and knows what it is to work diligently.몯
Both 몬loving people몭 and 몬cherishing objects몭 are fundamentally important. Valuing public property is part of being benevolent, and vice versa: if you don몭t place importance on resources, and instead use them wastefully, you cannot have 몬benevolence.몭 For example, imagine you몭re working overtime at the office. You몭re the last to leave, but you don몭t turn off your computer or the air conditioning, and you even forget to hit the light switch on your way out 멪 this behavior means that you don몭t have benevolence, because you don몭t 몬cherish objects.몭
In war, a benevolent general is one who loves his soldiers as though they were his own sons. In China, there is a famous story about the Warring States era (475-2221 BCE) general, Wu Qi. It몭s said that one of Wu Qi몭s men had a problem with his feet, which had become covered with festering wounds that oozed puss. When Wu Qi saw this, he got down on the ground, pressed his mouth to the soldier몭s feet and began to suck the puss out of his wounds. Later, the soldier몭s mother heard what had happened, and she was so distressed that she began to wail and cry. Someone asked her why she was crying 멪 after all, the great general had been so kind to her son. The mother replied, 몮My husband was a soldier too, and he had the same problem with his feet. General Wu did the same thing for him as he did for my son, and my husband was so moved by the general that he ended up sacrificing himself in a battle. Now that it몭s happened again, I몭m certain my son몭s going to give his life away, too!몯
Next: 몬courage.몭
Du Mu comments: 몮The brave general decisively orchestrates victory and forges ahead with momentum; he never hesitates, never yields an inch.몯
Chinese has a four-character phrase that translates directly as 몬fond of planning but lacking resolve,몭 which military experts use to describe someone who is always plotting and planning, but can never quite come to a firm decision. Why do people have this problem? It is because they have no courage! This behavior type is also common in the modern workplace: When you hear a colleague saying that a certain person can never seem to get things done, the basic problem with that person is a lack of courage, which causes them to be hesitant, slow and overly cautious. When someone behaves like this, it makes the people around them anxious.
Lack of courage in a general causes problems at two different stages of war. First, they몭re incapable of making a clear decision; and second, when they finally do settle on a decision, they don몭t have the resolve to execute it properly, and tend to flinch away from their work, ultimately backing themselves into a corner. 
No matter what you몭re setting out to achieve, it몭s important to embrace the spirit of self-sacrifice and to be willing to look death in the face and wrestle life from its jaws. It몭s worth mentioning here that although our stated aim in this book is to win first and fight later, there is no such thing as guaranteed success in this world. That몭s why you need courage to actually get things done.
Finally, let몭s look at 몬strictness.몭
Du Mu comments: 몮A strict general uses punishments and the prestige his name commands to maintain discipline among his forces.몯
Du Mu몭s commentary shows why, since ancient times, whenever a famous general first assembles troops ahead of launching a campaign, he always finds a reason to kill someone. It몭s a way to establish respect and fear. The ideal candidate for this kind of execution would be someone with high social status, perhaps a person who is trusted by the Emperor, and who considers themselves 몬untouchable몭 because they feel safe, sheltered in the shadow of the emperor. For example, Sun Tzu personally killed one of the King of Wu몭s favorite concubines, while the commander and author of one of the seven military classic, Sima Rangju, killed the Emperor몭s trusted aide, Zhuang Gu. The reason these people end up getting killed every time there몭s a war is that they didn몭t read the history books! People who believed themselves safe in the shelter of their titanic protectors were the easiest victims whenever there was a new war or political reform, because their status meant they were highly visible in the public eye, and yet they had no practical value to the state. Killing them is a way to enhance your authority without incurring any real losses for the state.
There몭s a life lesson here: no matter what you do, don몭t seek shelter between the legs of giants, because as soon as another giant so much as pats your protector on the back, you몭re liable to get squashed underfoot. You may think that you몭re as important as an extension of the Emperor몭s body, but you몭re not. As soon as the next political storm breaks, you몭ll be blown away like a speck of dust, or worse, your protector will be toppled and you몭ll be buried alive. This is one of the reasons why people of acumen follow the Confucian teaching of 몬walking the middle path몭 멪 they rely not on a protector but on their own independent personhood, their own value. They know their own value. They take care of themselves, make their own way in the world, are self-disciplined, follow the law, and do not overstep any boundaries. Only small-minded people seek out a protector, and their lives can never amount to much. 
		                                               ~
We몭ve now talked about 몬wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.몭 It몭s easy enough to talk about, but another matter entirely to put these virtues into practice. So, how is it done?
In the waning years of China몭s last empire, a Qing dynasty scholar and politician named Zeng Guofan was tasked with leading an army. He was a bookish man, and every day he would page through Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War. He measured himself against the standards of the five virtues, and it was clear that he didn몭t have any wisdom. After all, he몭d never even fought in a battle before! He could, at a stretch, claim to have sincerity and benevolence. As for courage, although he wasn몭t especially scared of dying, a lifetime devoted to scholarship had left him physically weak. His wrists were so limp, he didn몭t even have the arm strength to wring a chicken몭s neck! So, he could have had all the courage in the world, but he would never be warlike or fierce. The one virtue he really put into practice was 몬strictness.몭 The world around him had been in a state of chaos for his whole life, and he had a decades-long list of people who deserved to die. As far as he was concerned, the greatest act of benevolence for the people would be to 몮strew the country with evil men몭s corpses; then, benevolence and righteousness will once more return to the world.몯 In the end, he became known as 몬Zeng the scalp-shaver.몭
So, how did Zeng compensate for his lack of wisdom and courage? As far as he could see, there was no getting around the fact that he was basically inadequate, and the officers under his command were even worse 멪 they were just a motley bunch of peasants. His solution was to come up with two new virtues: 몬incorruptibility몭 and 몬clarity.몭
Zeng몭s reasoning for increasing the five virtues to seven was this: Ordinary soldiers are not qualified to demand that their leaders be wise, resourceful battle commanders; however, every person alive has a keen sense of their own interests, and soldiers are very aware of whether their leaders are clean in the way they handle money and fair in who they select for promotions. As a commander, to earn the respect of your men you cannot be greedy with money. Having 몬incorruptibility몭 means that you are transparent and always above board in the way you manage the accounts, and this is essential to gaining your subordinates몭 trust. When corruption is rampant in an army, there몭s no way that army is going to be able to fight. If you want your subordinates to trust and follow you, you should be stingy with yourself, but at the same time make sure that you regularly give out small rewards of money to your men, so that everyone is getting a piece of the pie.
Having 몬clarity몭 means that you keep careful notes about each of your subordinates몭 performance. You need to know who is always at the front of the charge, who is always close behind and ready to assist, who is always willing to risk their life and stand their ground, and who is always trying to stay out of danger. When you몭re not fighting, you should also closely watch who몭s hardworking and who몭s lazy. If you do this, you can give out the correct rewards and punishment, at the right time and in the right way.
As a commander, the question of whether you should be at the head of the charge is actually not very important, because you will often need to be directing proceedings from the rear. It몭s not even of primary importance to come up with ingenious plans and command every detail of what몭s happening on the battlefield. What몭s really important is to fairly distribute resources and have a clear idea of who is making a good example of themselves through excellent service, so you can achieve the correct balance between rewards and punishments. If you can do this, your men will be relaxed. When soldiers are relaxed, bravery comes easily, and they will be willing to lay down their lives for you.
The lesson here is that, as a leader, you need to not just pay attention to events, but to people as well. Don몭t make the mistake of thinking that if events are going in your favor, all is as it should be. Instead, you should make sure you know exactly what role each of your men is playing in the process of 몬everything going well.몭 You also need to have the ability to hand out both rewards and punishments. This is the only way to constantly improve your results.
People say that during the Chinese civil war (1927-1950 CE), the difference between the Communist army and the Nationalist army was that in the Communist army, the generals would shout: 몬Forward with me!몭 whereas the Nationalist generals would just shout: 몬Forward! For your commander!몭 This is actually nothing more than a myth. If you몭re the commander, and you몭re at the head of the charge, who will give the commands when you die? Who will be in charge of recognizing merit and giving rewards? Who will the soldiers follow? 
In the wars before the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) was formed, there was a warlord called Xiang Yu the Conqueror who always was at the front of the charge and in the thick of the fighting. But, the man who ultimately emerged victorious and founded the Han dynasty, Liu Bang, concerned himself only with rewards, punishments and working out who was serving him well and whose conduct fell short. It is far more important for a commander to have a clear picture of the conduct of his men than it is to fight alongside them. 
Zeng Guofan said that if you make 몬incorruptibility몭 and 몬clarity몭 your foundation, then 몬wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness몭 naturally and gradually follow. But, if you don몭t have this foundation, you cannot win the trust of your men, you won몭t be able to properly distribute rewards and punishments, and so the other five virtues become meaningless.



The bulk of a general몭s work is setting military discipline

Extract from the original text:
몮By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.몯

Analysis:
몬Method and Discipline몭 occupy last place in the line-up of the 몬Five Factors몭 (몬the Moral Law,몭 몬Heaven,몭 몬Earth,몭 몬The Commander몭 and 몬Method and Discipline몭). So, it is often not taken very seriously. Readers tend to think of it simply as meaning 몬keeping discipline tight,몭 but in reality it몭s much more complex and technical. This is where the bulk of a general몭s work is to be done, rather than in actual battles, which are only a small blip on the timeline in comparison. 
The original wording of this passage is quite arcane, but luckily Cao Cao elucidated the practical meaning in his commentary. 몬The marshaling of the army몭 refers to the framework of an organization 멪 its structure 멪 and to the system through which commands are given and relayed. 몬Graduations of rank몭 basically refers to 몬human resources몭 systems.
몬Method and Discipline몭 is another way of saying 몬management,몭 and it encompasses a range of management solutions. Of course, in today몭s world, 몬management몭 is a technical business term, but the modern concept of 몬management studies몭 traces its earliest roots back to the military management of armies.
The topic of an army몭s organizational framework is a very complicated one. There are similarities with business 멪 when a company grows at a faster rate than the management is able to keep up with, it몭s doomed to collapse. When rapid business development happens, it몭s common for the organizational framework to become unclear and the structure confusing and strange. It몭s important to bring in organizational change at regular intervals; when this is done well, the company can unleash huge amounts of energy, but when it몭s done poorly, it can be brought to its knees.
In modern China, the process of 몬Reform and Opening Up몭 brought about many structural changes, as well as changes to 몬the graduations of rank몭 among officials, and to infrastructure. It also led to the creation of many small government organizations of all kinds, and so cross-departmental organizations were introduced to coordinate the new structures and ensure that new reforms could keep moving forward.
In China, a common definition of a 몬hero몭 is someone who is possessed of both great natural talent and great strategic abilities. The early 20th century general Zhang Xueliang, who inherited control of the northeast of China from his father after he was assassinated, said: 몮My father had the natural talent, but not the strategic ability, and Chang Kai-Shek (the Nationalist leader who was defeated by the Communists) had the strategic ability, but not the natural talent.몯
Very well put! 
Zhang몭s father was one of the most talented men of his generation, but he lacked an advanced understanding of politics. Meanwhile, Chiang Kai-Shek always had well-formulated plans, but didn몭t quite have the talent to execute them. Coming back to the 몬Five Factors,몭 these two qualities of a well-rounded 몬hero몭 can be divided like this: 몬strategic abilities몭 fall under the domain of 몬the Moral Law,몭 몬Heaven몭 and 몬Earth,몭 while 몬The Commander몭 and 몬Method and Discipline몭 fall under 몬natural talent.몭 A commander must have natural talent in order to effectively organize an army, mobilize troops, and provide guidance and driving force for an army in motion.
In business, successful entrepreneurs are both naturally talented and adept at strategy. However, between these two qualities, natural talent is more important. That몭s because you can always ask other people몭s advice on strategy or hire consultants, but the talent to execute can only come from yourself. If you have talent, it몭s possible to become a successful entrepreneur even without strategic ability. If you have strategic ability but little natural talent, the obvious choice in ancient times would be to become an advisor. In modern times, your best bet would be to start a consulting business.
Throughout Chinese history, the forces that have founded new dynasties have always been a perfect alliance of talented leaders and strategically sharp advisors. Some examples include Liu Bei (the founder of the Han kingdom of Shu, in modern-day Sichuan Province;  Zhuge Liang; Zhu Yuanzhang, the first Emperor of the Ming dynasty; Liu Bowen; Liu Bang, the first Emperor of the Han dynasty; and Xiao He.



The Dao is really just soft power

Extract from the original text:
몮Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this way: (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Dao (Moral Law)?몯

Analysis:
Sun Tzu took a seven-point approach to weighing the balance of the 몬Five Factors몭 between opposing forces, and the first point is represented by the question: 몬Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Dao?몭
Earlier in this book, we saw that the Dao is defined as 몬causing the people to be in complete accord with the ruler.몭 To achieve this, the ruler must widely share the fruits of victory, govern the people with appropriate policies, and not be stingy in handing out rewards and noble titles.
Commentators from different eras used the same historical example to illustrate this line from Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: The general Han Xin몭s choice during the wars following the collapse of the Qin dynasty to fight for Liu Bang (who went on to become the first Emperor of the Han dynasty) instead of his rival warlord, Xiang Yu. 
Liu Bang apparently asked Han Xin: 몮Why have you chosen to follow me now, and not Xiang Yu?몯
Han Xin replied: 몮Xiang Yu treats the people cruelly, and is always reluctant to reward those who serve him. He has a big official stamp, specially made to mark letters of ennoblement and reward, yet he is loath to use it and always hasty to snatch it back to his bosom. He keeps it close to him and caresses it so much that its corners have become worn and rounded. But you, my lord, are different 멪 you govern the people with clear and simple rules, you reward your followers, and you set slaves free.몯
Being willing to spend money was an excellent choice by Liu Bang. After all, no matter how big the checks he wrote, it was always someone else who had to pay, because at that time he was a revolutionary in a crumbling empire that did not yet belong to him. But, he also did not hesitate to use what money he had already secured in his purse. He bought the loyalty of his enemies몭 generals with the help of his advisor, Chen Ping, who did his dirty work for him. He didn몭t seem to have a budget, and even after emerging victorious as Emperor of China, he continued to spend at will. When he first announced new policies as Emperor, he declared that whoever brought him Xiang Yu몭s head would be made a lord of 10,000 households and granted the title of Marquis. When Xiang Yu finally gave up at the River Wu, just before he slit his own throat, he was looking at the crowd of Liu Bang몭s soldiers surrounding him when he saw a man who used to fight for him, Lu Matong. Xiang Yu cried out to Lu: 몮Lu Matong, my old friend! My head is yours!몯 Then Xiang Yu drew his knife and cut his own throat. The other warriors didn몭t pay any attention to Xiang Yu몭s last words, and hurried to seize the warlord몭s body for themselves. After the body had been hacked to pieces, five different men ended up with Xiang Yu몭s body parts. They all went to Liu Bang, each seeking credit for bringing Xiang Yu to their lord.  Liu Bang didn몭t ask any questions, and immediately settled the matter by making all five of the men Marquises.
The Dao of Liu Bang was to orient himself downwards, towards the people; his Dao manifested in the rewards mechanisms he used and in his methods of governing his people. His approach to politics and governance was miles apart from Xiang Yu몭s. For example, after Liu Bang delivered the finishing blow to the collapsing Qin dynasty, he didn몭t touch the fallen empire몭s treasure troves or the women. He didn몭t move into the imperial palace, and he immediately sealed the state treasury. He withdrew his troops, and established just three laws: anyone guilty of murder will be executed; anyone guilty of harming another person will be beaten; and anyone guilty of theft will be punished accordingly. He then abolished all of the harsh laws and draconian punishments that had been enforced under the old Qin legal code. Because of Liu Bang몭s actions, the people of Qin loved him devotedly. They continued to whole-heartedly support him from behind the lines during the wars that followed.
But after Xiang Yu declared himself Emperor and banished Liu Bang, he slaughtered the people of the old Qin capital, Xianyang, and killed the Qin king, Ziying, whose life had originally been spared by Liu Bang after he surrendered. Xiang Yu then loaded up wagons with Qin몭s riches and women and carted them away before setting fire to the Qin palaces and government buildings. The fire burned for three months. So, why did Xiang Yu kill those people when peace had already been secured? He did it so that he could take their women and valuables. Xiang Yu몭s actions show that he didn몭t comprehend how to take possession of an empire; his desires went no further than riches and women.
After Xiang Yu seized the women and wealth of Qin, he split the state in three, and in each of these three areas he installed one of his followers, giving them the title of 몬king.몭 Because of this, people in the province of Shaanxi even today talk about 몬the three Qin regions.몭 So who did Xiang Yu pick to be the three kings of Qin? In fact, they were all former generals of the Qin Empire who had surrendered: Zhang Han, Sima Xin and Dong Yi. What kind of background did these men have? Between them, they had been in command of 200,000 Qin troops when they surrendered to Xiang Yu. Accepting their surrender, Xiang Yu had all 200,000 of their men buried alive. Only the three generals were spared. Because of this, the people of Qin hated their guts; these men had betrayed 200,000 of their own countrymen and had acquired vast riches and status for their deeds. These were the men who Xiang Yu later charged with the vital task of leading armies raised from among the people of Qin to block Liu Bang몭s advance at the strategic mountain pass town of Hanzhong. But, given their past, how could they be expected to succeed?
By asking the question, 몬Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Dao,몭 we can see why Xiang Yu lost so badly against Liu Bang.
Even further back in history, the first leader who really had the Dao was Lord Tang of the state of Shang, who became the first King of the Shang dynasty. It is said that when he was digging foundations for a house, he unearthed some human remains that had been buried without any plaque identifying the deceased몭s name. Tang treated the remains respectfully, and gave them a proper burial. Word spread of this deed, and people said: 몮Tang of Shang is so respectful to dead people; he must be even more respectful of living people!몯 Later, Tang saw peasants who had set up nets in the shape of a closed rectangle, to catch birds. He ordered them to take down the nets on all but one side, urging them not to kill wantonly, but to give the birds a chance. When word spread of this deed, people said: 몮Tang of Shang treats animals so well; he must treat people even better!몯 
Because of Tang몭s reputation, when he launched military campaigns to attack states in the east, people in states to the west complained: 몬Why won몭t he attack us?몭 Likewise, when he attacked states to the east, people in the states to the west were offended. Everyone wanted Tang as their ruler.
Having the Dao 멪 the Moral Law 멪 is the same as having soft power. Liu Bang had soft power, whereas Xiang Yu relied entirely on hard power. 몬Having the Dao몭 is another way of saying that someone has great charisma. It is also the same as the Confucian concept of having the 몬Way of the King.몭 The Confucian philosopher Mencius explained that there is a difference between The Way of the King and The Way of the Hegemon. The Way of the Hegemon requires control over a huge country and relies on the power brought by extensive territory and well-stocked armories. When a ruler follows The Way of the Hegemon, the extent of his kingdom is directly proportionate to his material power. By contrast, The Way of the King does not require a large state; it can be practiced just as well in a small state, and then used to expand the small state until it covers the entire known world. Lord Tang originally ruled over a very small state, and King Wen, the first King of the Zhou dynasty, only had a slightly larger state; both men were rulers of small fiefdoms, but both won the hearts of people all over China by practicing The Way of the King.
Mencius몭 words offer great insight to those of us engaged in smaller-scale endeavors. The Way of the King is not only for kings; it is about how to become a king. What about you? Are you imbued with the Dao? Is your boss imbued with the Dao?


Figure out the 몬Five Factors and Seven Considerations몭 and you몭ll learn who will win and who will lose. Then, it is time to send your army to deliver your result on the battlefield
 
Extract from the original text:
몮(1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Dao (Moral Law)? (2) Which of the two generals has most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline (laws and commands) most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment? By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it will suffer defeat 멪 let such a one be dismissed!몯

Analysis:
The second question, 몬Which of the two generals has most ability,몭 is about comparing the skills of each side몭s commanders. There is a common scenario in war, where one side knows that the enemy has a dangerously good general and so refuses to engage in battle. Instead, they send agents to pay off the enemy king몭s advisors and ministers, and sow division in the enemy ranks, souring relations between the king and his star general. Then, the enemy king recalls the general and sends out an unqualified fool to take command of the front line. As soon as this happens, you can attack and win the war in one fell swoop.
The third question is about who holds the advantages that come from heaven and earth, including timing and terrain. A good example of this is when Russia annexed the Crimea in 2014. Russia held all the advantages of terrain and timing, and America and the European Union could only watch helplessly from the sidelines.
The fourth question is: 몬On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?몭 Cao Cao comments: 몮When laws are established they are not to be broken, and if they are broken, the offender must be executed.몯 There is a story about Cao Cao honoring this principle. He was on the march with his army, and it was the season when wheat was just about ripe. He told his men that anybody who damaged any wheat would be separated from their head in swift order. Little did he expect that his own horse, taking fright, would bolt into a wheat field and trample the crops. This was a conundrum. He obviously couldn몭t cut off his own head, so instead he drew his sword and cut off his beard.
In the original text, the words 몬laws몭 (fa) and 몬commands몭 (ling) are used (translated together as 몬discipline몭 in the English version). Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Laws should be used to bring the people together, and commands should be used to make them as one.몯
The fifth question is, 몬Which army is stronger?몭 Du Mu comments: 몮Leaders and followers must be in harmony; the side that has the courage to fight and which also has more soldiers and chariots is the stronger.몯 Zhang Yu comments: 몮The stronger side has sturdier chariots, stronger horses, braver soldiers, and sharper weapons; when the men hear the war drums they feel joy, and when they hear the gong (which signals retreat) they feel filled with anger.몯
The sixth question is, 몬On which side are officers and men more highly trained?몭 This question is loaded with meaning, and is not at all the same as asking which army is stronger. In general, people have a high potential to be moulded, meaning that any ordinary, run-of-the-mill person can become a professional in any field of work, provided they have the right training. Even more so, it몭s important to be aware that if a person spends their whole life training in only one thing, they can become world-class in that one thing.
If you put in work and sweat during peacetime, less blood will be spilled in times of war. For example, what makes 몬special forces몭 special is not that they are full of superhumans, but rather the training they receive, and the massive investment that goes into that training. Before a mission, they train for months on end in a location modeled to simulate the mission location, rehearsing again and again all of the potential scenarios that might arise during the actual mission. Training is everything; it is indispensable to achieving goals, whatever they may be.
The seventh and final question is, 몬In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?몭 Reward and punishment is a field of study all its own, and it wouldn몭t be wrong to call it the factor that determines an army몭s combat effectiveness. Reward and punishment hinge on two vital requirements: they must be both timely and appropriate.
To quote from the ancient military text, The Methods of the Sima: 몮By not delaying in giving rewards, the people are able to quickly realize the benefits of good behavior. By not making exceptions in dispensing punishments, the people will quickly witness the dangers of bad behavior.몯 If the leader doesn몭t hand out rewards and punishments at the right times, his effectiveness will be heavily compromised.
Another early commentator on Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, a man named Wangzi, comments: 몮If rewards do not fit with what is called for, then they only lead to waste and not to gratefulness; if punishments do not fit with what is called for, then they lead only to slaughter and not to reverence.몯 People won몭t be grateful for what you give them if you hand out rewards casually, and if you use punishments excessively, all you몭ll get is people몭s hatred and anger.



The 몬Way of righteousness몭 and the 몬Way of deception몭

Extract from the original text:
몮While heeding the profit of my counsel (ji6), avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules. Accordingly, as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one몭s plans.몯

Analysis:
Cao Cao comments: 몮This lies beyond ordinary methods.몯
Li Quan elaborates in his commentary: 몮When a favourable plan has been decided upon, then harness the changes in circumstances; 몬helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules몭 means 몬that which is beyond ordinary methods.몭몯
Du Mu comments: 몮Calculating advantages and dangers is fundamental to all military matters. When the advantages and dangers have been identified, then one may seek additional opportunities beyond the ordinary methods in order to press one몭s advantage.몯
Although I previously said that Sun Tzu몭s approach to planning is about calculating and comparing the positions of both sides, rather than coming up with ingenious tricks and ploys, he actually doesn몭t take tricks and ploys entirely off the table. They occupy one section of The Art of War, which begins with the line: 몮All warfare is based on deception.몯
Planning, along the lines of the SWOT analytical model, is fundamental 멪몬heeding the profit of my counsel몭 means determining through calculations that the odds of victory are on your side. Once you몭ve done this, it몭s time to go to war. But, beyond the fundamentals, Sun Tzu says that you should 몮avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.몯 What he means by this is that you should adjust your plans to take advantage of opportunities.  
Du Mu comments: 몮It is impossible to foresee what we call 몬circumstances.몭 Circumstances may be favourable to the enemy and thus disadvantageous to me, or they may be disadvantageous to the enemy and thus favourable to me; when circumstances reveal themselves, then you can begin to create from them an advantage, and thus secure victory.몯
Wang Xi comments: 몮As concerns 몬circumstances,몭 they are about harnessing changes.몯
And so, this passage opens a discussion about how to gain advantage from the changing circumstances of a battle, while avoiding the dangers; how to turn disadvantages into advantages, respond to opportunities and seize the initiative, master the shifting contours of a battle in real-time, and create momentum. These topics are discussed in detail in The  its 몭s fifth  chapter (Formation), and sixth chapter (Energy), which together embody the essence of Sun Tzu몭s insights.




Inability to wait is a major character flaw

Extract from the original text:
몮All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy, spreading disorder. Then, crush him. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.몯

Analysis:
In this rapid-fire passage, Sun Tzu reels off twelve deception-based strategies, most of which aim to trick the enemy into making an error of judgment. It몭s about using temptation to force a mistake. But, what do you do when the enemy doesn몭t fall for your trick? What you do is wait. In this game, you need to out-wait the enemy, send agents to infiltrate their camp, and make all kinds of arrangements for different scenarios. Essentially, you have to wait until the balance is broken and the odds of victory tip in your favor; only then can you engage in combat.
Sun Tzu몭s basic principle is to win first and fight later. Or, if you can몭t win, you don몭t fight. If the odds aren몭t in your favor, you wait.
This is precisely why it is a major character flaw to be incapable of waiting. People often think that real men, or heroes, have to fight. They don몭t understand that waiting is actually part of fighting, and an extremely important part at that.
There is a passage in the ancient Tang dynasty military text, Questions and Replies between Emperor Taizong of Tang and Duke Li of Wei, in which the Emperor says: 몮Through my readings of military books both ancient and new, I have discovered that there is but one crucial teaching 멪 use a multitude of diverse methods to fool one몭s foe. That is, it is necessary to think of every possible way to entice the enemy into making a blunder; he makes one false move, and you expose his weaknesses.몯 
Duke Li of Wei, a prominent Tang dynasty general, replies in the text몭s dialogue: 몮That is correct. War is like chess: one false move, and you lose control of the entire board. Nothing you do after that can restore what you have lost.몯
Unfortunately, Emperor Taizong몭s grandson, Xuanzong, lacked his grandfather몭s wisdom. At a key moment of the devastating An Lushan Rebellion, imperial general Geshu Han was in possession of an impregnable fortress at the mountain pass of Tongguan, blocking the path of the rebel An Lushan몭s armies towards the capital, Chang몭an. Geshu Han was intent on holding his position, and dead set against marching out to engage the enemy. But Xuanzong was eager to end the rebellion, and ordered Geshu Han to attack An Lushan in the open field. Geshu Han was faced with a difficult choice. Xuanzong had previously executed two of the Empire몭s leading generals, Feng Changqing and Gao Xianzhi, because he considered them inept. Even though Geshu Han knew that attacking An Lushan would doom his army, he also knew that if he refused to attack it would cost him his own head, with some other general being sent to take his place. So, he was forced to lead his forces out of the fortress. His 200,000-strong army was annihilated and Tongguan Pass was lost. When Xuanzong realized in a panic that the capital was vulnerable, he fled for Sichuan.
Our commentators had a lot to say about these twelve stratagems of deception, so in the following chapters we will take a closer look at each of the stratagems in turn.


       
Truly great generals only need one decisive battle to win a war

Analysis:
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Seeming weak when in fact you are strong, seeming timid when in fact you are brave; this is how Li Mu defeated the Xiongnu, and how Sun Bin destroyed Pang Juan.몯
Li Mu, a general from the state of Zhao, was one of the four great generals of the Warring States period (475-221 BCE), the other three being Bai Qi, Lian Po and Wang Jian.
Li Mu was in charge of the garrisons of the Dai and Yamen commanderies, tasked with fending off the Xiongnu, who were nomadic warriors from the steppes to the north of China. Li Mu treated his soldiers exceptionally well, trained them rigorously and carried out frequent inspections. He insisted that his men obey just one order: Fighting the enemy is forbidden! He decapitated anyone who had the audacity to leave camp looking for a fight. For years, Li Mu studiously avoided fighting. Because he had a strategy of 몬fortifying the walls and evacuating the countryside,몭 which required all of the local people to retreat behind the fortified walls of his garrison camp, when Xiongnu raiders came prowling there was nothing for them to loot. 
Li Mu continued with this strategy for several years, never engaging in a fight. This was distressing not only for the Xiongnu raiders, but also for his own men, and for his king. Believing Li to be a coward, the King of Zhao recalled him and sent a new general in his place. The new general scrapped Li Mu몭s strategy, and made regular trips out of the camp with his troops to attack the Xiongnu. This didn몭t go well; he lost more battles than he won, and suffered heavy losses in the process. The King of Zhao had no choice but to ask Li Mu to return to his old post, but Li Mu declined, pleading bad health. 
The King of Zhao, now out of options, promised Li that he would never again meddle in his military strategy. So, Li Mu returned to his post and reinstated his strategy of 몬absolutely no fighting.몭 However, this did not mean he was idle during those years 멪 in fact, he was even busier than if he몭d been at war the whole time, personally running an intense training regime for his troops. After years of training in camp, Li Mu몭s border defense army was in excellent shape, morale was high, and his men were so eager for action that they would have been willing to go without pay or reward just for one proper fight against the Xiongnu. Meanwhile, the Xiongnu had grown complacent.
Finally, Li Mu decided the time was right for a decisive battle. He carefully selected his best troops and equipment 멪 1,300 war chariots, 13,000 war horses, 50,000 foot soldiers brave enough to charge the enemy lines head-on, as well as 100,000 archers 멪 and he marched to war. Li employed the stratagem of 몬luring the enemy in deep,몭 first sending a large number of nomadic herders with accompanying livestock out into the countryside. The Xiongnu sent a small force to intercept the nomads and steal their livestock, and Li Mu allowed them to 몬win,몭 intentionally losing several thousand men to the Xiongnu. The Xiongnu were elated by their little victory, and their chieftain, Chanyu, decided to launch a full invasion with a much larger force. As the Xiongnu advanced, Li Mu spread his troops wide in an ambush formation, surrounding the invaders on two sides. With one stroke, Li eliminated 100,000 Xiongnu cavalry. The Xiongnu chieftain fled into the wilderness, while the victorious Li Mu took full advantage of the momentum his victory gave him to attack and destroy two other nomadic tribal confederations, the Chanlan and the Dong Hu, while also subjugating the Lin Hu. For more than ten years after this battle, the Xiongnu didn몭t once come near the borders of Zhao. 
Military thinkers put great store in the ability to win a war with a single, decisive battle. War should not be a back-and-forth process; instead, generals should save their energy and build their strength, waiting for the opportune moment to end the war in a single move. Some might consider a general to be 몬great몭 if, during a ten-year command at a frontier fortress, he fought 100 battles and won all of them in spectacular fashion. But, what if the price of this general몭s valor is 10,000 corpses on the battlefield? The general retires with a glittering record, yet not a single problem has been solved. Then, the next 몬great몭 general is sent out to carry on doing the same thing: to keep on fighting. Li Mu was an exception. He bided his time and didn몭t fight a single battle for ten years, and when the time finally came, he fought just one battle, and in doing so he actually solved a problem for his country.
I hope I have now shown why the ability to win a war with a single battle makes a general truly great. What good are a hundred victories? All it means is that you몭ve fought many, many times without solving the problem, and at the end of those 100 battles, you still have to keep on fighting! A general with a 100% record in 100 fights is actually incompetent, lacking even a basic understanding of the art of war. Anyway, the example of a hundred-victory general is hypothetical 멪 have you ever heard of a general with that good a record? Anyone who would make that claim isn몭t telling the whole story. The truth is that a certain number of losses are inevitable.
The principle of this chapter can be applied to anything you do, and summarized as: 몬When the time isn몭t right, don몭t do a thing. When the time comes, use only a single move, and make sure it solves your problem.몭 The undoing of many a project comes from chronic over-activity, and the motivation behind chronic over-activity invariably boils down to some kind of anxiety complex. If you ask Li Mu what losses he incurred by refusing to fight, the answer would be 몬none.몭 But, that didn몭t prevent the troops under his command, or the Xiongnu, or the King of Zhao from feeling anxious. Anxiety is what caused the King of Zhao to act, recalling and replacing Li Mu, rather than any reasonable objection to Li몭s performance. After all, Li had done his job, which was to defend the border, flawlessly. The king몭s anxiety made him feel that he had to do something, and that only by doing something would he relieve himself of this feeling of anxiety. 
Beware of acting from a place of anxiety; it will very likely be your undoing.
Remember to focus on the work that is actually important: 1) Preparation; and 2) Waiting.
Preparation is up to you. It involves building strength, training your forces and drumming up morale. Waiting, on the other hand, means waiting for the enemy to make a mistake, for an opportunity to present itself. If the enemy doesn몭t make a mistake, it will be very difficult to win. As Emperor Taizong said, the art of deception in war is about making use of various solutions in order to lure the enemy into slipping up. The main way of doing this 멪 the most frequently used way 멪 is expressed in Sun Tzu몭s line: 몮When able to attack, we must seem unable.몯 It has worked time and time again.
Li Mu몭s example, biding his time for ten years, is an extreme one. But, it is not the most extreme. That accolade might go to King Gou Jian of the Warring States kingdom of Yue, who waited for 18 years to destroy his rival, Fuchai, King of Wu.



Only a handful of simple stratagems exists to choose from. The key is knowing how to put on a show

Extract from the original text:
몮When using our forces, we must seem inactive.몯

Analysis:
The meaning of this line is the same as the previous one (몬When able to attack, we must seem unable몭). Let몭s look at another classic case study: the battle of Baideng during the early years of the Han dynasty.
After Liu Bang established the Han dynasty in 206 BCE, he launched a campaign against the Xiongnu, the same northern nomads who featured in the previous chapter. At first, Liu Bang, now known as Emperor Gaozu, won victory after victory. Pleased with his achievements, the Emperor was keen to launch an all-out assault on the Xiongnu and root them out once and for all. He sent over a dozen reconnaissance agents to the Xiongnu area, all of whom came back telling of depleted Xiongnu armies 멪 no warriors and no horses. The time was ripe to attack, they said. Emperor Gaozu sent another advisor, Lou Jing, to carry out further reconnaissance. Lou Jing returned from his mission and told the Emperor that he must not attack. When the Emperor asked why, Lou Jing replied that it is normal when two countries go to war for each side to show off their power. Yet, all that he saw in the Xiongnu lands was emaciated horses and listless soldiers; all the men seemed old, feeble, disabled or sick. Obviously, this was a Xiongnu trick to lure us in, a show that they were putting on for our benefit, he said.
But Emperor Gaozu had already made up his mind to go to war. As he listened to Lou Jing, he flew into a rage and had Lou thrown into a dungeon. He accused the man of distracting him from his battle plans, and threateningly told him he몭d deal with him after he returned victorious from the war. 
Emperor Gaozu mobilized all the forces at his disposal and gave the order to march. He and his armies were camped on the Baideng plateau when they were ambushed by the Xiongnu chieftain. A force of 400,000 Xiongnu warriors completely surrounded Emperor Gaozu. The enemy was not exactly 몬depleted,몭 after all. They had plenty of horses, too 멪 a mass of white horses hemmed in the Chinese forces from the east, black horses from the west, and red horses from the north. To put the two sides몭 cavalry resources in perspective, Emperor Gaozu couldn몭t muster up a handful of uniformly white horses to pull the chariots for his honor guard on the day he ascended his throne as Emperor of all China.
The Han army was besieged for seven days and seven nights, despite several desperate attempts to break through the enemy encirclement. Hunger exacerbated the effect of freezing temperatures, and many soldiers lost fingers to frostbite. Emperor Gaozu knew that he was trapped, and he turned to his spy, Chen Ping, for advice. Chen Ping, a past master in the arts of deception and inciting insurrection, hatched a plot. Chen went to the Xiongyu chieftain몭s queen, offering her a bribe and telling her: 몮The Han Emperor is no ordinary mortal; he is favored by the gods. Have you heard how he beheaded the white snake at the beginning of his rebellion against the old Emperor? If your people keep fighting him, there is no way to know if it will bring fortune or ruin to the Xiongnu, but for you personally, it몭s sure to bring ruin.몯 The queen asked Chen Ping: 몮What ruin do you speak of?몯 Chen replied: 몮You Xiongnu are not used to life in southern lands, so it will bring you nothing good if you seize our land. The only reason your people fight against us Han is because you want our women, our gold and our silk. There are a great many beautiful women in our lands, and men are easily corrupted by money; if your chieftain gets hold of our gold, silk and beautiful women, he is sure to lose his affection for you, my lady. But there is another way: we can give you gold and silk right now, and you can make sure that your husband does not lay hands upon any beautiful women.몯
The queen was impressed by Chen Ping몭s reasoning, which seemed to her to get right to the heart of the matter. What good was it to her whether or not her husband became even greater than he already was? What mattered to her was that she could use her husband for her own benefit. So, one night in bed with the chieftain, she began to push the idea that Emperor Gaozu had the gods on his side, and she urged her husband not to do anything extreme.
The Xiongnu chieftain felt ill at ease 멪 not least because Emperor Gaozu had always had an aura of power about him 멪 and he began to feel uncertain about what the next day might bring, not to mention the worrying failure of his two allies to arrive at the agreed time. What if they had turned against him and joined Emperor Gaozu? The chances of this were not small. After all, his wife had already been turned against him. So, the chieftain decided to quit while he was ahead. He negotiated a treaty, took his money and allowed Emperor Gaozu to return home.
Anyone can see how simple Sun Tzu몭s stratagems are. Nobody actually needs thirty-six stratagems anyway; four or five are enough to cover any situation. The important part is the execution. When you put on a show for your enemy, you have to know how to scratch their metaphorical itch. And, when you몭re on the receiving end of one of these 몬shows,몭 you몭re in a similar position to a soccer goalkeeper getting ready to defend a penalty shot. As you watch the striker, you know for sure that, no matter what trickery he tries, he몭s either going to shoot to the left or to the right. But, what you can never know is which way he will shoot on this particular occasion 멪 left or right? This means that if you fall for the trick this time, this doesn몭t mean you won몭t fall for the same trick again next time. It몭s the same with the reports about the Xiongnus몭 emaciated horses and listless warriors: it몭s possible that this represents the real situation, but it몭s also possible that it몭s a trick. Emperor Gaozu, just like a goalkeeper choosing between left and right, made a judgment call. Based on what he knew, he decided that the reports coming in from his reconnaissance agents did in fact represent the Xiongnus몭 real situation. At that point, it was impossible to say if he몭d fallen for a trick. His agents could just as easily have come back with reports of powerful Xiongnu armies, and Emperor Gaozu might have determined that this was a trick, and attacked anyway.
Even more rational decision-making was demonstrated by the Xiongnu chieftain and his queen 멪 you certainly couldn몭t say in that situation that the chieftain was fooled by Emperor Gaozu.
One positive trait about Emperor Gaozu emerged from this story. When he returned with his army, he set Lou Jing free and granted him a noble title. Gaozu had the courage to admit when he was wrong. However, he also executed every one of the reconnaissance agents who had told him he should attack the Xiongnu. It turns out he wasn몭t so good at taking responsibility for decision-making.
On the subject of taking responsibility for decision-making, the Qing dynasty scholar and general, Zeng Guofan, offers his thoughts: 몮I am the decision-maker, and the responsibility for my decisions lies with me, not with my advisors. There is no such thing as a certain outcome, and one cannot simply look at outcomes, nor blame advisors.몯 He also critiqued himself in his diary: 몮Even though I know not to, I still find it difficult not to scowl when I cross paths with someone whose advice I have listened to with the result that I have got something badly wrong. But this is my problem, and I need to pay more attention to that fact.몯
If Emperor Gaozu devoted half the thought to these things that Zeng Guofan did, a dozen or more families would have been spared a terrible fate.



No certainties in victory and defeat 멪 the leader must take responsibility for decisions

When Emperor Gaozu withdrew his army from Baideng, he freed from prison the advisor who had urged him not to go to war, Lou Jing, and gave him a noble title. In this respect, he did a better job than Yuan Shao, a general of the late Han dynasty, and subsequently a warlord after the Han dynasty collapsed.
Before the battle of Guandu, after which Cao Cao established dominance over north China, Yuan Shao몭s advisor, Tian Feng, told his lord that it would be better to hold his position than to attack. In response, Yuan Shao repeated Emperor Gaozu몭s words of several hundred years earlier, to the effect that Tian Feng몭s advice was distracting him from his planning. Yuan Shao threw Tian Feng in a dungeon and threatened to deal with him upon his victorious return. But, Yuan Shao lost his battle. When news of the defeat spread, the jailer told Tian Feng: 몮Looks like you몭ll be alright this time.몯 But Feng Tian replied: 몮You don몭t know our lord. If he몭d won, he몭d be in a fine mood and would forget about how I wronged him. But if he really has lost, he몭ll feel humiliated by the very sight of me. Killing me will be his way out of having to face that humiliation.몯 Sure enough, Yuan Shao accused Tian Feng of gloating over his lord몭s defeat and put him to death.
While Emperor Gaozu cannot be directly compared with Yuan Shao, Gaozu did kill the advisors who told him the Xiongnu were open to attack, because of his own failure to take responsibility for his decisions, choosing to outsource it to them instead.
Zeng Guofan dedicated part of his writings to the need for leaders to stand up and take responsibility for their decisions. He felt compelled to do this because he knew there are no certainties in victory and defeat, and these things are not simply a matter of planning.
Zeng included five different examples to illustrate his points, of which three address the same subject: various Emperors몭 attempts to weaken overly powerful feudal lords and bring them to heel.
The first example is from the Han dynasty. An advisor named Chao Cuo advised Emperor Jing to do something about the dangerously powerful feudal lords, and as a result, six regional 몬kingdoms몭 rose up in rebellion, demanding that the Emperor 몬cleanse himself of evil influences몭 by executing Chao Cuo. In a panic, Emperor Jing hastily complied, executing Chao Cuo. But this didn몭t stop the King of Wu from continuing his insurrection. Eventually, Emperor Jing emerged victorious, and so the outcome in this case was that the Emperor successfully wrested power away from his feudal vassals.
Much later, during the Ming dynasty, two advisors, named Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng, urged the Jianwen Emperor to do the same thing, with the result that the King of Yan rebelled and similarly demanded the execution of Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng. The Emperor did indeed kill them, but of course this did not persuade the King of Yan to stand down his troops, and in the end the Emperor was defeated. In this case, the attempt was unsuccessful.
Finally, a Qing dynasty advisor named Mi Sihan gave the same advice to the Kangxi Emperor. The general Wu Sangui, who had previously helped establish the Qing dynasty, rebelled. However, the Kangxi Emperor did not execute Mi Sihan, and eventually managed to put down Wu Sangui몭s revolt. In this case, the outcome was a success.
These three examples are similar in terms of circumstances and historical background, but differ in the way that the various Emperors dealt with them and in their outcomes. So, when dealing with momentous issues, or when making decisions in the face of uncertainty and doubt, it몭s important to think deeply about what is right and what is wrong. It몭s equally important not to cling to past successes or defeats. When faced with an intense situation, do not fold 멪 situations are always temporary. And, be even more careful not to blame your advisors.
Now, let몭s move on to Zeng Guofan몭s two remaining examples:
In the twilight years of the Tang dynasty, Emperor Zhaozong had become very angry about his subjects몭 lack of respect for the Imperial house. Wanting to march in force against the warlord Li Maozhen, he asked his prime minister, Du Neng, to take charge of his army. Du Neng refused in no uncertain terms, telling the Emperor: 몮If I go, all that will happen is that I몭ll end up executed just like Chao Cuo, and it will do nothing to stop disaster befalling the realm!몯 Emperor Zhaozong did not accept Du Neng몭s refusal, and Du was left with no choice but to go.
In the end, the Tang imperial army was no match for the warlord Li Maozhen, who sent a formal petition to the Emperor, demanding that Du Neng be executed. When Du Neng heard about this, he said to Emperor Zhaozong: 몮This is exactly what I said would happen!몯
Emperor Zhaozong did not have the makings of a hero. In the pressure of the moment, all he could do was sob and snivel. He told Li Maozhen that he would let Du Neng decide what to do about the situation. Then, he demoted Du Neng to the post of governor of Wuzhou, before 몬allowing몭 him to commit suicide.
In this case, Du Neng suffered an even more unjust fate than Chao Cuo, Qi Tai and Huang Zicheng.
In his writings, Zeng Guofan had sharp words for Emperor Zhaozong, condemning him for forcing Du Neng to act against his will and then turning around and selling Du Neng out, having him killed. Such behavior, Zeng wrote, is that of a king who will not have a country to rule for much longer. Zeng criticized himself too, writing: 몮In my fighting days, sometimes I would make plans on the basis of some advisor몭s counsel, and subsequently suffer defeat. Perhaps I did not directly blame the advisor, but I몭m sure that the next time I saw him, the ugly feelings I felt would have been plain to see on my face. I must attribute this to a lack of insight on my part; I was not thorough enough in my own training.몯
Zeng went on to reflect on the 몬ugly feelings몭 on his face by writing about one more historical example:
The last Emperor of the Tang dynasty, Emperor Mo, was deeply worried, suspecting that a man named Shi Jingtang was plotting rebellion. The Emperor몭s advisors, Li Song and Lu Qi, told him that if Shi Jingtang really was considering rebellion, he would need support from the Khitans (a non-Chinese nomadic people from the far northeast). They advised that if the Emperor could establish good relations with the Khitans, Shi Jingtang would no longer have the opportunity to rebel. The Emperor decided to use their plan. Yet, a different advisor, Xue Wenyu, sowed seeds of doubt in his mind, questioning how the Emperor, the very Son of Heaven, could stoop so low as to treat barbarian savages as honored guests in his court. Xue mockingly quoted a poem about the female poet Zhaojun to drive his point home: 몮The country relies on a clear-sighted sovereign; how can our safety be left to women?몯 Emperor Mo was persuaded to change his mind. He berated Li Song and Lu Qi, accusing them of trying to doom his daughter to an early grave. The two advisors fell to their knees and apologized profusely, but apparently Lu Qi wasn몭t fast enough to kneel 멪 he had a medical problem with his legs 멪 and Emperor Mo accused him of arrogance. Lu Qi protested, pointing out that the Emperor was well aware of his bad legs, but Emperor Mo demoted him anyway.
Just as the advisors predicted, Shi Jingtang ended up joining forces with the Khitans, and eventually destroyed the Tang imperial armies. Emperor Mo knew then that he shouldn몭t have listened to Xue Wenyu, and he felt full of rage. He summoned Xue for a drubbing, shouting at the man: 몮You horrid thing! The very sight of you makes me tremble with rage!몯 He almost pulled out a knife to stab Xue, there and then. Emperor Mo was doomed; he ended up vanquished at the hands of Shi Jingtang.
Summing up, Zeng Guofan wrote: 몮In most cases, those who, suffering defeat, blame their chief advisors, are simply expressing their nature, which is that of a mediocre person.몯
So, there is no certainty in victory and defeat. The fact that there are success stories from the past does not mean that they can be replicated, but it also does not mean that they can몭t be replicated.
Leaders must take responsibility for their decisions. If things end up in a mess, blaming the person whose idea it was does nothing more than prove that you몭re a 몬mediocre person.몭



Ballplayers feint with every step, but do not confuse this with the real fundamentals of winning

Extract from the original text:
몮When we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away.몯

Analysis:
What Sun Tzu is talking about here is 몬strategic deception,몭 which at its core means making the enemy unprepared and unable to defend themselves. If the enemy is prepared and able to defend themselves, the odds are against you. If the enemy is unprepared, and unable to defend themselves, you can bring all of your strength to bear on them, and they will buckle under the pressure.
A famous example of this principle is the story of Han Xin crossing the River Wei using water pitchers.
During the time when Liu Bang was fighting against Xiang Yu in the war between the new states of Chu and Han, following the collapse of the Qin Empire, Liu Bang was, for a while, in a precarious position, and his ally king Wei Bao decided to switch allegiance, going over to Xiang Yu몭s side. On the pretext that his mother was ill, Wei Bao asked Liu Bang to allow him to return home. Then, he about-faced and declared for Xiang Yu. Liu Bang immediately sent his general Han Xin to fight Wei Bao. The two armies arrived at Linjin, where they were separated from each other by a river. Han Xin promptly assembled over 100 boats, and lined them up by the riverbank. Every day Han Xin put on a show, making it look like he was just about to lead his army across the river. On the opposite bank, Wei Bao kept his troops in battle formation, ready to fight. Meanwhile, Han Xin was secretly sending men to buy and make wooden and clay water pitchers 멪 round at the bottom, with a narrow spout. Eventually, Han Xin moved a large force along the river to Xiayang, where he had his men lash the pitchers together into rafts. His army floated across the river, and attacked the town of Anyi on the far bank. Wei Bao was now outflanked, and ended up getting captured.
When Wei Bao heard that Han Xin had crossed at Xiayang, he was shocked: 몮There are no boats at Xiayang!몯 he cried. 몮Where did he get boats?몯
In this example, Wei Bao failed to grasp the concept of using 몬substitution몭 as a problem-solving technique. Just because you don몭t have boats doesn몭t mean you don몭t have other tools for crossing a river.
Han Xin was using the stratagem of 몬being near but making the enemy believe you몭re far away.몭 If you want to attack the enemy from afar, you have to put on a show for them nearby. 
Another example of this stratagem comes from the struggle for supremacy between the states of Wu and Yue during the final years of the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE). The Wu and Yue forces stood on either side of a river, so the Yue commander sent troops in both directions, up and down the river. Positioned a few miles apart, they waited for night and then began beating war drums and moving toward the Wu forces. The Wu commander was forced to split his army and send men in both directions to face the advancing Yue soldiers. However, the reason the Yue commander waited until night to stage his little show was that in fact the forces he had sent up- and down-river had more drums than fighting men. It was a bluff. With the Wu forces divided, the Yue commander crossed the river with his main force and attacked the Wu army head-on, routing their soldiers and dealing a massive blow to the kingdom of Wu.
In this case, both sides understood the concept in play 멪 the bluff 멪 also known in Chinese as 몬threatening from the east, striking from the west.몭 But, of course, bluffs are not always bluffs, and threatening from the east does not necessarily mean the strike will come from the west. It몭s entirely possible that the strike will come from the same direction as the threat. The analogy of the soccer penalty shot serves well here. The goalkeeper knows very well that the striker will use a feint, but also that the feint might not be a feint. In other words, the striker might be feinting a feint. In this confusing tangle of deception and reality, who can win? The striker can win if they are steady, accurate, and powerful. But if the striker lofts the ball above the goal, it won몭t go in regardless of what the goalkeeper does. For the goalkeeper to win, he needs fast reactions and a bit of luck. The goalkeeper also has the option of using a feint against the striker.
But what does the daily training of both strikers and goalkeepers consist of? Do they spend all day practicing feints? No, of course not. Their training has three main parts: physical fitness, skills and team tactics. These three things also happen to be the essence of warfare.
If you believe the historians, you몭d think that what made Han Xin a great general was his craftiness and his cunning tricks, but would be a mistake to say that this is what war is all about. Great generals are just like CEOs 멪 the fundamentals of their work consist of operations management. Operations management is why Han Xin once said that, while Liu Bang could not lead more than 100,000 soldiers with any effectiveness, Han Xin himself would take all the soldiers he could lay his hands on. You could give him a million men, and he몭d still be able to control them as if they were extensions of his own hands. If you want to know what Han Xin몭s true strength was, look no further than this.
The Thirty-Six Stratagems is an entertaining story, but it doesn몭t represent the reality of war. Zeng Guofan actually said he was doubtful that the story of Han Xin crossing the river with water pitchers is really true. His reasoning was that it would be physically impossible to make rafts out of clay water pitchers that would be capable of ferrying a large army across a river. Zeng Guofan also debunked the other most famous story about Han Xin몭s exploits, in which Han Xin erected a makeshift dam using sacks of earth. According to the story, after the dam was built, the water downriver was shallow enough for the enemy army to cross, but when they몭d only crossed halfway, Han Xin had the sacks of earth torn down, effectively bursting the dam and drowning the enemy army. Zeng Guofan pointed out that it would be impossible to dam a large river just with a group of men throwing sacks of dirt in the water, and it would be even more impossible to instantly tear down such a dam. Who exactly was supposed to have done the demolition job, and how? The answer is that nobody did it, because it몭s impossible.
Zeng wrote: 몮After certain battles that I won with the Hunan army, I read some reports that writers were publishing about my victories that I found quite astonishing. I had no idea that this was how the battles had actually been fought! 몬Strange,몭 I thought to myself, 몬it can몭t have been me they were writing about!몭몯
In his conclusion, Zeng mused: 몮I몭m not yet one of history몭s dead generals, and yet these battle reports have morphed so beyond recognition in my own lifetime that I scarcely dare believe it. Well, Sima Qian (a great historian of the Han dynasty) was after all a writer, too 멪 there can be no doubt that some sensational and embellished sources must have figured in his research into the stories of Han Xin.몯
There aren몭t many stratagems, and they몭re all well-worn tools of the trade, familiar to commanders on either side of any conflict, all of whom have read the same military books. Any time there is a battle, the same old stratagems are sure to be used. For example, you might (in your head) say to your adversary: 몬Regardless of where I attack you, I must find a way to trick you into thinking it will be somewhere else. You know that I몭m trying to trick you, and you know I might be trying to trick you into thinking I몭m tricking you, when in fact I haven몭t tricked you, and I really am going to attack in the place where it looks like I몭m going to attack.몭
What does all this amount to?
Ballplayers feint with every step, but do not confuse this with the fundamentals of winning.



Want great success? You몭ll have to give up three things. Number one: Greed

Extract from the original text:
몮Hold out baits to entice the enemy, spreading disorder. Then, crush him.몯

Analysis:
Li Quan comments: 몮An enemy who is greedy for gain will inevitably become disordered. An enemy who is disordered can be crushed.몯
I몭d like to re-use a previous chapter몭s historical example to illustrate this: the story of how Li Mu defeated the Xiongnu.
Li Mu몭s strategy of fortifying his defenses and clearing the countryside, and then closing the gates for ten years without ever coming out to fight, left his own men as well as the enemy beside themselves with pent-up frustration. Li Mu몭s men had their fill of good food and drink every day, and they were also receiving excellent training 멪 their frustration came from a desire to serve their country on the battlefield, to repay the kindness they had enjoyed. The enemy, on the other hand, had been deprived by Li Mu몭s strategy of things to steal or loot. After ten years, they몭d been reduced to miserable poverty.
A decade into the standoff, the moment came when Li Mu decided the time was right to go out and fight. Though he was quite content to not fight at all, once he decided to move against the enemy, he did so with overwhelming force, mustering all his strength and aiming of settle the score with a single battle. This was his choice, and his enemy had no idea that he meant for this battle to be the only, and final, battle of the war.
The first thing Li Mu did was to order a massive number of local nomads to release their livestock to graze on the plains 멪 the countryside was instantly filled with herders. The Xiongnu responded by sending out a small mounted invasion force. Li Mu intentionally lost the first engagement with the Xiongnu force, sacrificing a few thousand men to the enemy. The Xiongnu chieftain was delighted when he heard about this and, licking their lips at the thought of the loot waiting to be pillaged, the Xiongnu followed their leader in an invasion of the border country. Meanwhile, Li Mu had deployed his men in a pincer formation around the Xiongnu몭s flanks, catching them in an ambush and vanquishing over 100,000 Xiongnu cavalry. Li Mu routed the Xiongnu chieftain, destroyed the Chanlan people, defeated the Dong Hu barbarians, and forced the Lin Hu barbarians into submission. For the next ten years, the Xiongnu didn몭t once dare to set foot over the border into the state of Zhao.
Greed is a huge weakness of human nature. During the Warring States period (475-221 BCE), Duke Mu of Qin once asked his advisor Jian Shu what he needed to do to claim dominion over the entire world. Jian Shu replied: 몮Those who would rule over all the world must renounce three things: greed, anger and haste. Greed brings much loss, anger brings much difficulty, and haste brings many mistakes. If one can thoroughly examine the scale of potential harms and benefits, and plan accordingly, what need is there for greed? If one can think from one몭s counterpart몭s position and weigh one몭s own position against theirs, what need is there for anger? If one can accurately measure the amount of time required for various things, slow or fast, and plan unhurriedly, what need is there for haste? My lord, if you can renounce these three things, dominion will not be far away.몯
Any time you need to make a judgment call or get something done, you need to have a good grasp on two concepts:  go after things that benefit you, and stay away from things that put you in danger. These two concepts are equally important, but although people should in theory maintain a 50:50 balance between them, more often than not the ratio is somewhere between 70:30 and 90:10, in favor of going after benefit. The reason for this is that things that are beneficial tend to be highly visible, and they몭re more exciting. Meanwhile, danger tends to lurk in the shadows, and because it seems so far away, people tend to think they can get away with leaving such things to chance. We often see people doing high-risk things even though the payoff is extremely small. This is because the payoff is immediate, while the danger, no matter how obvious, can be dismissed by the hopeless logic of 몬Maybe it won몭t happen.몭
If you몭re not greedy, you can몭t be tricked. All tricks basically boil down to greed. When you몭re defrauded in some get-rich-quick scheme, the person who몭s tricked you is actually yourself.
This is how people are. When they see profit, they몭re capable of going to extraordinary lengths to trick themselves, using self-talk like: 몬Go for it! You몭ll be fine!몭
It몭s important to not let your desires sway your judgment when profit and danger are involved.


If you can몭t win, you must be able to wait

Extract from the original text:
몮If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.몯

Analysis:
If the enemy is 몬secure at all points,몭 meaning that they hold a strong military position, victory is out of reach. In that case, you have to employ the stratagem of waiting, and avoid making any rash moves. The Tang dynasty military strategist, Duke Li of Wei, put it like this: 몮If you see that the enemy is exposed, then attack; if you see that the enemy is secure, then halt.몯
As for the line, 몬If he is in superior strength, evade him,몭 Mei Yaochen comments: 몮If my enemy has superior strength, I must stay clear of the sharp edge of his sword.몯
Du You comments: 몮If the enemy몭s treasury is well supplied and his soldiers are filled with vigor, then you must retreat and wait for him to slacken; watch for changes and respond accordingly.몯
People often think that the only way to get opportunities is to take action first, but this is a mistake. That몭s because they forget to look at the other side of things, and there몭s always a price to be paid for any action. There몭s a common modern Chinese saying that expresses this quite well: 몬If you go looking for ways to die, then you몭re going to die.몭
We are reminded of the truth in this by the opening words of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: 몮The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin.몯 
In war, every move is a matter of life or death, not just for the soldiers out fighting battles, but also for the state itself. Above all else, be as careful as you possibly can. This is the first of three principles at the heart of this chapter.
The second principle is the concept that the best thing you can do is to know ahead of time who is going to win; you can몭t just make victory happen. If you properly analyze your own situation and the enemy몭s, you can work out whether or not the odds of victory are on your side. If they몭re not, you can march to war and fight as hard as you like, but victory will always slip away from you. It simply cannot be forced. If the enemy is as battle-hardened as you are, no amount of cheerleading or chest thumping will help you win, especially since the enemy will be thumping their own chests just as hard.
The third principle is the idea of not trying to fight 100 battles and win 100 victories, but finishing the war with a single battle. Fighting a long war back and forth, without having something to show for your efforts, is a waste of blood, money and rations, particularly because once you몭re in that situation, you have to keep going. Any general who gets stuck in the mud like this is committing a deadly sin. You need to get the timing right, move from a position of stability, and fight with overpowering strength when the time comes. This is how to solve problems.
 So, the steps to be followed when the enemy has greater strength and holds a solid position are: 1) Be prepared and avoid fighting; 2) Be patient and keep yourself under control; 3) Use smooth diplomacy; 4) Wait for the enemy to let down their guard or make an unforced error, and then trick them into more mistakes (as Emperor Taizong said: 몮Use a multitude of diverse methods to fool one몭s foe몯); and 5) Get your timing right, and strike while the iron is hot.
For a classic demonstration of these principles, let몭s turn to the War of the Three Kingdoms, which followed the collapse of the Han dynasty, and look at how the Wu general Lu Meng defeated the renowned Han loyalist general, Guan Yu.
We begin with Guan Yu in the Yangzi River province of Jingzhou. He commanded a powerful army and could boast of 몬a hundred victories in a hundred battles.몭 He had even received the surrender of one of the state of Wei몭s most feared generals, Yu Jin, and his name inspired popular rebellions that he directed from afar against his enemy, Cao Cao, in many parts of north China. The name of Guan Yu inspired awe throughout all of China, to the extent that Cao considered changing his capital city to put more distance between himself and the spearhead of Guan Yu몭s forces. But Cao Cao몭s general, Sima Yi, had a plan. He claimed that there was no way the neighboring state of Eastern Wu would want to see Guan Yu become any more powerful, so Cao Cao should form an alliance and join forces with them to deal with Guan Yu together. That is exactly what happened.
Guan Yu actually only had control of Jingzhou because his commander-in-chief, Liu Bei, had borrowed the province from Eastern Wu몭s Emperor, Sun Quan. Of course, Liu Bei was reluctant to give it back, and following negotiations it was divided up. Half went back to Eastern Wu and half remained in Liu Bei몭s hands. This situation was a sore point for Eastern Wu. At the same time, Guan Yu was becoming recklessly arrogant. When Yu Jin surrendered, 30,000 men and horses under his command were handed over to Guan Yu. Without enough provisions to feed these extra mouths, Guan Yu made a shocking move 멪 he seized granaries controlled by Eastern Wu, adding insult to injury. Emperor Sun Quan made up his mind to do something about it.
Liu Bang and Sun Quan were allies, and Guan Yu몭s main aim in Jingzhou was to use it as a base to launch campaigns against the state of Wei. Guan Yu was obsessed with capturing the Wei fortress of Fancheng, but at the same time he was wary of the potential threat posed by Eastern Wu. He feared that if he made moves to attack Fancheng, he would make himself vulnerable to attack from behind by Eastern Wu general Lu Meng. Because of this, Guan Yu left a large reserve force behind to defend Jingzhou.
As for Cao Cao, he could see that Guan Yu was too powerful to fight, and was keen to stay away from him. Likewise, Lu Meng could see that Guan Yu held a strong position, and so spent his time making preparations. For Lu Meng to stand a chance of taking Jingzhou, he would have to make Guan Yu pull out his defensive forces. In other words, Jingzhou would have to pivot from a 몬secure몭 situation to an 몬exposed몭 one.
Guan Yu faced a dilemma: he needed to transfer some of his forces from Jingzhou to the front line in the north, because he didn몭t have enough manpower to take the fortress at Fancheng. Yet, at the same time, he needed to leave enough troops in Jingzhou to guard against a possible attack from Lu Meng. This was the situation when Lu Meng came up with a plan: he would pretend to be sick.
It actually wasn몭t hard for Lu Meng to convince people he was sick, because he really did get ill quite often, and this was already common knowledge. In fact, he did actually die of an illness after this part of the war was over. So, pleading sickness, Lu Meng returned to the capital city of Jianye and sent Lu Xun to command the garrison in Lukou in his place.
At the time, Lu Xun was still a young man, and very much an unknown entity. When he arrived in Lukou, he wrote a letter to Guan Yu, waxing lyrical about how much he admired the great general. He essentially claimed to be Guan Yu몭s number one fan, and breathlessly told him how it was the honor of his life to be his neighbor, and that he hoped Guan Yu would be like an uncle to him, looking out for him while he was still young and inexperienced. Lu Xun also made it very clear that he would never dare make an enemy of the great Guan Yu.
Guan Yu was disarmed, and marched his Jingzhou garrison forces to the front line at Fancheng with peace of mind. Immediately, Lu Meng pounced from the sideline at the head of a large army, taking Jingzhou and cutting off Guan Yu몭s line of retreat. The war was soon over; Guan Yu was captured and promptly beheaded.
Guan Yu몭s defeat was the root of Liu Bei몭s ultimate failure. Jingzhou was the key to controlling the Central Plain of the Yellow River; once it was lost, Liu Bei was no longer a contender in the contest to unify all the lands of China. After losing Jingzhou, Liu Bei몭s brilliant general, Zhuge Liang, was forced to launch a doomed assault on the central plain by traversing the famously impassable Daba and Qinling mountain ranges from the Shu city of Hanzhong. Rugged terrain made transporting food supplies very difficult, even with Zhuge Liang몭s legendary invention, the wheelbarrow. Tragically, Guan Yu몭s death led directly to the deaths of his sworn brothers, Zhang Fei and Liu Bei, about whom so many stories were written.
Guan Yu is a classic example of the concept, 몬A hundred fights and a hundred victories means that one defeat will spell ruin.몭 Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War tells us that 몮good fighters have neither a reputation for wisdom nor merit for courage.몯 This is precisely because good fighters don몭t fight many battles, and the battles they do fight are easy, uneventful and certainly not epic. They don몭t make for good stories.
Anyway, stories are only good for entertaining civilians. Guan Yu was the exact opposite of Sun Tzu몭s model general 멪 his glory echoed all across the land, and he was immortalized by ordinary people everywhere for being a perfect combination of virtue, wisdom and strength. But professionals have a different take: Guan Yu was a leader who led his country to ruin.



Pay attention to this stratagem. Forgetting it is a common mistake

Extract from the original text:
몮If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him.몯

Analysis:
Du Mu comments: 몮A general who is of fierce, unyielding temperament may be provoked into a rage; then, he will pursue gratification and pay no mind to his best-laid plans.몯
Being able to trigger an enemy몭s rage is like casting a magic spell. They will forget all about what they were trying to achieve, and instead will instantly do whatever it takes to free themselves of their hate and anger. In the end, they throw their life away, without ever relieving themselves of the emotions that doomed them.
This stratagem is basically a trick designed to trip up proud and hot-headed generals. One of the seven ancient military classics, The Wei Liaozi, notes: 몮A broad-minded man cannot be provoked into rage.몯 When your enemy is a relaxed kind of person, it won몭t be easy to trick them by making them angry.
A classic example of this stratagem is the defeat of Cao Jiu by Liu Bang몭s forces during the battle of Sishui River, before the establishment of the Han dynasty.
Xiang Yu held a position at Chenggao, and a face-off there against Liu Bang had sunk into a deadlock. Liu Bang몭s gambit was to hit Xiang Yu from behind. He sent his commanders, Lu Wan and Liu Jia, across the White Horse Ford at the head of over 20,000 men, to link up with Peng Yue, duke of Jiancheng. Their combined force attacked the region of Liang beyond Xiang Yu몭s forces, successfully taking around a dozen cities and cutting Xiang Yu몭s supply line.
Xiang Yu몭s hand was forced. He split up his army and personally led part of his forces to backtrack and attack Peng Yue, leaving General Cao Jiu in charge of holding Chenggao. Just before Xiang Yu left, he gave Cao Jiu detailed instructions: 몮Make sure you hold Chenggao. If the Han army tries to attack, stay well clear of them; don몭t give battle, don몭t let them take the east. Within 15 days, I몭ll have Peng Yue몭s head and the Liang region will be under my control. Then I몭ll come back and resume command.몯 
After Xiang Yu left, Cao Jiu did what he몭d been told, holding his position and refusing to come out. This is where our stratagem of the day makes its appearance. Liu Bang built a raised platform just outside Chenggao몭s walls, which he used as a launchpad for shouting a constant stream of verbal abuse at the enemy. He kept the insults coming for five or six days without stopping, until the enemy troops couldn몭t stand to listen for a single second longer. Cao Jiu lost his temper. Forgetting all about Xiang Yu몭s plan, and what he was supposed to be doing, he became hell-bent on going out to teach this pack of rascals a lesson. Cao Jiu stormed out through the gate with his army behind him, wading across the Sishui River. Unsurprisingly, Liu Bang used the standard tactic of attacking when the enemy was still in the river. Cao Jiu was badly beaten, Chenggao was lost, and the tide of the war turned. Knowing his career was over, and too ashamed to face Xiang Yu, Cao Jiu slit his own throat by the riverbank.
This stratagem was also attempted by Zhuge Liang against Sima Yi, but on that occasion he wasn몭t able to pull it off.
Because Guan Yu had lost the province of Jingzhou, the only way for Liu Bei몭s Han forces to move north. out of the area that is now Sichuan Province. and attack Cao Cao몭s state of Wei was to cross through the steep and inhospitable mountains between Han and Wei. Zhuge Liang attempted to do this many times, but the problem was that the terrain made it impossible to bring enough food supplies, which is the main reason each campaign ended with Zhuge Liang pulling up short before the finish line. The campaigns lasted roughly a month each time, which was the maximum period Zhuge Liang could stay in the field without being forced to head home without enough rations to get his men back over the mountains. So, Zhuge Liang had to fight fast, ideally only in pitched battles in open country. Cao Cao and his generals knew the score 멪 all they had to do was hold firm for a month and hunger would force the enemy to go home. If they could avoid fighting, victory was theirs, but if they did fight things became a lot more uncertain. Of course, not fighting quickly became the unquestioned strategy of all of Cao Cao몭s commanders. 
During Zhuge Liang몭s final drive north into Wei, his army came face-to-face with Sima Yi몭s forces on the Wuzhang Plain. As usual, there was no way Sima Yi was going to get involved in a fight, despite all kinds of provocations by Zhuge Liang, including insult of gifting Sima Yi with a set of women몭s clothing. Sima Yi wasn몭t falling for it; he was not going to get dragged into a fight. Zhuge Liang was so exhausted by his efforts, physically and mentally, that he got sick and died while still in the field. His death marked the end of Liu Bei몭s northern expeditions.
Sima Yi is a strong example of a player who has his head in the game. He never forgot what his goals were, and he stuck to the basic playbook. 
Forgetting our intentions is a mistake that we all make, and the reason isn몭t always anger. Any kind of distraction can pull us further and further away from what몭s important, without our even realizing it, and we end up chasing after unimportant details while losing sight of the essentials.
This is why the Buddhist scriptures tell us: 몮Never forget why you started; this is the only way to accomplish your mission.몯
Every day, we should evaluate everything we do against our original motivation, our plan. At the same time, we have to say 몬no몭 to unhelpful urges, stay strong in the face of temptation, block out distractions, stick to our plan, and never forget why we started.



No shame in showing weakness. Whatever you do, don몭t fight for the recognition of others, especially temporary recognition 

Extract from the original text:
몮Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.몯

Analysis:
The goal of 몬pretending to be weak, that the enemy may grow arrogant몭 is to make your enemy underestimate you. If the enemy underestimates you, they won몭t prepare properly, and so they will be vulnerable to sudden attack.
A classic example of this stratagem is the Xiongnu chieftain Modun몭s invasion of the Donghu barbarians.
Modun came to power as chieftain of the Xiongnu Empire at the same time that the Qin dynasty was crumbling. The Donghu were very powerful at the time, and sent a messenger to ask the Xiongnu chieftain a favor: 몮Your father, Touman, had a terrific horse,몯 the messenger said, 몮a very fast horse. How about you hand it over?몯
Modun looked around at his advisors, and asked them: 몮Well, should I give them the horse?몯 The advisors responded that this was terribly rude of the Donghu. Modun몭s father몭s horse was a treasure of the Xiongnu people; why should they give it up for no good reason?몯
But Modun said, 몮It몭s good to be kind to our neighbors, and after all, it몭s only a horse! I will gladly give it to them.몯
Not long after this incident, a Donghu messenger came again, and delivered this message to Modun from his chief: 몮You have an awful lot of wives; why don몭t you give one of them to me?몯 Modun몭s advisors were furious, and shouted: 몮You have gone too far, Donghu! How dare you come to our chieftain asking for wives! We should send our warriors to punish you!몯
But, once again, Modun said: 몮It몭s good to be kind to our neighbors, and all they want is a girl; why be so stingy? Give them what they want!몯
More time passed, and the Donghu messenger came again. This time, he said: 몮You have thousands of miles of land that you몭re not using; why not give some of it to us?몯
Modun asked his advisors what they thought. They hesitated. Since their lord had been willing to give up his own wife to these people, they weren몭t sure what they were supposed to say. In the end, they mumbled something non-committal, along the lines of, 몮Well, we could give them the land, or we could not, either way...몯
Modun went ballistic. 몮The land is the very substance of our country,몯 he raged. 몮How could I give it away?몯 He immediately beheaded all of the advisors who몭d said, 몬give them the land,몭 and then he sent his warriors to attack the Donghu. The Donghu, unprepared because they hadn몭t taken Modun seriously, were wiped out. Now that Modun was on the warpath, he didn몭t stop. He annexed in one fell swoop the Yuezhi nomads in the west, Loufan, Baiyang, the Great Bend of the Yellow River in the south, and Yan and Dai in the north. By the time Modun몭s rampage was finished, he몭d reclaimed all of the Xiongnu territory that had been lost during their war against the Qin dynasty general, Meng Tian. It was also Modun who later surrounded Liu Bang (Emperor Gaozu) in the battle of Baideng, and signed a peace treaty with the Chinese Emperor granting him equal status as the Emperor몭s 몬brother.몭
When Emperor Gaozu died, Modun had ideas of invading Han dynasty China. Modun몭s queen had recently died, so he decided to send an envoy to Emperor Gaozu몭s widow, Empress Lu, with a highly improper message. It read: 몮I am now a lonely lord멞 and I yearn to visit China. Your majesty, you too must be lonely now, living all alone. Since we two have both been saddened by unhappy circumstances, I express my wish for us to have once more what we have lost.몯
Modun was in effect asking the Chinese Empress if she몭d like to marry him.
Of course, Empress Lu was livid, as were the ministers in the Han court, and an old general named Fan Kuai even asked permission there and then to lead 100,000 crack troops to sweep the Xiongnu into oblivion. But the General of the Household, Ji Bu, shouted: 몮Fan Kuai, you should be executed for such a suggestion! Do you forget that our late lord the Emperor once led a host of over 400,000 men against the Xiongnu, and yet he was surrounded at Baideng? How, Lord Fan Kuai, do you propose to 몬sweep the Xiongnu into oblivion몭 with only 100,000? To even suggest that you could do this is tantamount to lying to your Empress!몯
Empress Lu had the final say. She decided not to go to war with Modun, but to continue with the old policy of appeasement. She sent a letter back to him, in which she wrote: 몮My thanks to the great chieftain for thinking of us in these times. However, I fear that we have nothing here that is worth seeing, only endless mountains, treacherous passes and soldiers. If the great chieftain insists on visiting, I am afraid he will find that our poetry and books are rather dull, and the best thing to do would be to allow our fine soldiers to guide you on a hunting foray. As for me, I am old and frail, and my teeth and hair are falling out. But if it몭s hunting that interests the great chieftain, we will be delighted to accommodate him!몯
Modun could see from the Empress몭 letter that she was fully in control, so he shrugged and let go of his invasion dreams. After all, he몭d only been testing the waters to see if the Emperor몭s death might have opened an opportunity to add China to his collection of territories. 



Fighting tired

Extract from the original text:
몮If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.몯

Analysis:
The idea is to be well rested while the enemy is exhausted. If you find yourself facing an enemy who is 몬taking his ease,몭 then harass him, causing him headaches however you can. Make him so tired that he doesn몭t have the energy to fight all-out on the battlefield.
A classic historical example of this stratagem is the war between the states of Wu and Chu during the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE).
When king Helu of Wu attacked Chu, he asked for advice from General Wu Zixu, who responded: 몮You may divide your army between three commanders. First, order only one commander to attack. The enemy is sure to counter-attack with all the force at their disposal, and then our commander should order his men to retreat. Then, wait until the enemy has withdrawn their forces, and immediately launch a new attack led by the second of your three commanders. When the enemy marches out to fight, retreat once more. Continue in this way, constantly forcing the enemy into action, employing a multitude of deceptions, until they are too exhausted to fight with conviction. Then, attack with all three commanders, and the enemy will fall at once.몯
King Helu did exactly as Wu Zixu advised, and over the course of the next year, the Chu general Zi Chong led his forces out to fight seven times, never successfully, and giving all that he had in the effort. Finally, the Wu army launched an all-out assault, and captured the Chu capital, the city of Ying.
Much later, in the beginning stages of the War of the Three Kingdoms, Cao Cao was locked in a struggle with a northern warlord named Yuan Shao. Just before the two sides clashed in the decisive Battle of Guandu, the strategist Feng Tian presented a war plan to Yuan Shao, but Yuan refused to listen. This was Feng Tian몭s plan:
몮Cao Cao is a skilled military commander, and he will not easily be bested. It would be best to settle in for a long conflict. You have a secure position because of the four provinces under your control, which affords you the protection of mountains and rivers. You should focus on the external and the internal at the same time. Externally, seek alliances with strong generals; internally, focus on improving the state of both your fighting men and agricultural production. After honing your men몭s fighting skills, divide them into multiple stealth units, and send them south of the Yellow River to harass whichever regions are vulnerable. Then, if the enemy counter-attacks from the right, strike to the left, and if they counter-attack from the left, strike to the right. In this way, the enemy will become too exhausted to fight effectively, and their people will be unable to go about their daily work in peace. You will wear the enemy down without any hard work on your part. Within three years, you can defeat them. This is the strategy I present to you today. But if you have already made up your mind to claim victory now, in a single battle, or else be vanquished in the attempt, there will be no use for regrets after it is done.몯
Chairman Mao Zedong expressed the same basic ideas as Feng Tian when he summarized the Red Army몭s strategy during the Chinese Civil War: 몮The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.몯 
The art of war is actually very simple. What몭s difficult is making good judgment calls. For example, when you see enemy forces approaching, how do you know if they몭re just planning to harass you a little bit and then leave, or if they몭re launching a full-on attack? In truth, there몭s no way of knowing. That몭s why Chairman Mao also said: 몮On the battlefield, all strategy is forgotten.몯 In the heat of battle, you constantly have to respond to emergency situations at a moment몭s notice, which leaves no time or mental capacity to think about things like strategy or the art of war.
The way to deal with this problem is to stay away from the overall situation, and also to stay one step ahead of the enemy, so that they go where you want them to, rather than the other way round. 
In terms of your own position, you have to set yourself up in an impregnable position, protect yourself, and do not rashly commit to a fight if it means moving away from your position. Be like Li Mu, building up your defenses and sheltering your resources in the safety of your walls, closing your gates and not allowing yourself to be provoked into coming out until you몭re ready. If you몭re not ready after a year, keep preparing. If you몭re not ready after ten years, still keep preparing. Then, the moment you are ready and an opportunity arrives, blow your enemy away in a single battle.
In terms of dealing with the enemy, remember how Emperor Taizong summarized 몬all the books on war, ancient and new.몭 He said it all boils down to: 몮Using a multitude of diverse methods to fool one몭s foe.몯 Do whatever it takes; use your imagination.
All of the ancient generals read the same military texts. And they didn몭t just read them 멪 they memorized these books by heart. So, why was there such a huge gap between their abilities to get results? The distinguishing factor is whether or not generals have good judgment. Without it, you can몭t effectively judge the situation in front of you. On the surface, the problem seems to be that you misjudged the enemy, but the real problem is misjudging yourself. As long as you can make accurate judgments about yourself, whatever the enemy does, you will naturally know how to deal with them.

During the Warring States period, the states of Qin and Zhao fought against each other in a conflict called the Battle of Changping (262-260 BCE). A Zhao general named Lian Po found himself on the losing end of several battles, and decided to hole up in the safety of a fortress. The Qin forces saw that Lian Po had no intention of coming out to fight, so they sent agents to Zhao to spread rumors that the Qin commanders didn몭t think Lian Po would be difficult to deal with, and that they were much more worried about another Zhao commander, named Zhao Kuo. The Zhao king fell for the Qin trickery and, ignoring the desperate pleas of Zhao Kuo몭s mother and his advisor Ling Xiangru not to do it, sent Zhao Kuo to take over Lian Po몭s command. In the end, this led to a terrible tragedy 멪 the Battle of Changping ended in the brutal deaths of 400,000 Zhao troops.
Why did the King of Zhao fall for the Qin trick? Even before the Qin agents spread their rumors, the king was not at all pleased with Lian Po몭s losing record, nor his subsequent unwillingness to fight more battles. However, the king didn몭t have a good excuse to replace Lian Po. That is, not until the Qin agents did their dirty work. So, as far as the king was concerned, these rumors had been a great help; they even saved him the effort of working out which general to send out to replace Lian Po.
Let몭s turn again to the wars between Liu Bang and Xiangyu following the collapse of the Qin dynasty. Liu Bang spent a year trapped by Xiang Yu in the city of Xinyang, cut off from outside help and supplies. Luckily, Liu Bang몭s advisor, Chen Ping, had a plan. He pointed out that Xiang Yu only had a handful of capable men giving him advice: Fan Zeng (whom Xiang Yu so respected that he called him his 몬second father몭), Zhong Limei, Long Qie and Zhou Yin. If a wedge could be driven between people in Xiang Yu몭s camp, these four men could be eliminated, and Xiang Yu would become much easier to deal with.
Liu Bang gave Chen Ping 40,000 catties of gold, which he used to bribed a few of Xiang Yu몭s officers to spread rumors that Fan Zeng and Zhong Limei were dissatisfied that, despite doing more than anyone else for Xiang Yu, they hadn몭t got what they deserved: the title of 몬king.몭 According to the rumor, Fan Zeng and Zhong Limei had already entered into a secret alliance with Liu Bang to destroy Xiang Yu, and that afterwards they would split Xiang Yu몭s kingdom between them. 
When the rumor reached Xiang Yu몭s ears, he became suspicious. He started to doubt Zhong Limei몭s loyalty, and stopped talking with him about important issues. He even suspected Fan Zeng of secretly communicating with Liu Bang, and began to treat him quite rudely.
To put one more nail in Fan Zeng몭s coffin, Chen Ping contrived to put on a show. One day, when a messenger from Xiang Yu visited Liu Bang몭s camp, Chen Ping ordered servants to lay out an exquisite spread of fine meats and wines for the messenger. He then asked the man: 몮What instructions from Lord Fan Zeng?몯 The messenger, perplexed, responded: 몮I was sent by Xiang Yu, not Fan Zeng.몯 Immediately, Chen Ping changed his tune. 몮Oh! We thought you몭d been sent by Fan Zeng!몯 he said, and ordered the servants to take away the fine meats and wines, and ushered the messenger into another, much less comfortable room, where he was served cheap tea and plain rice. Then, Chen Ping walked out, leaving the messenger to his own devices. Of course, the messenger was outraged. He had not expected to be humiliated like this. When he returned to his own camp, and told Xiang Yu what had happened, Xiang Yu became fully convinced that Fan Zeng was in cahoots with Liu Bang.
Fan Zeng kept on trying to give Xiang Yu advice 멪 he suggested stepping up the siege efforts, but Xiang Yu blankly refused to listen. Fan Zeng knew why his lord was behaving so out-of-character: it was because of outside forces spreading rumors that he was in league with Liu Bang. He knew that Xiang Yu had been tricked, and so he asked for permission to return home. Xiang Yu let him go without a second thought.
Chen Ping몭s little show was far from subtle, so why did Xiang Yu fall for it? It was because Xiang Yu was already suspicious, and because the rumors were mostly true. For instance, it was true that Zeng Fan and Zhong Limei had made a bigger contribution than anyone else to Xiang Yu몭s rise, and it was true that they did not hold the title of 몬king.몭 Xiang Yu had always been stingy, and reluctant to reward his men. As Han Xin said, Xiang Yu owned stamps specifically carved to grant people the titles of 몬king몭 and 몬duke,몭 and yet he could barely bring himself to let them out of his grasp. On the rare occasions that he did, he quickly snatched them back. This was a weakness in his psyche, and the rumor played to this weakness perfectly 멪 he couldn몭t help but believe it.
What about Fan Zeng? Did he do anything wrong? Actually, yes. Before the war began, Xiang Yu once had a chance to kill Liu Bang at the Feast of Swan Goose Gate, but let him go despite Fan Zeng urging him to take advantage of the opportunity to eliminate his rival. After Liu Bang made his get-away, Fan Zeng was furious, and shouted abuse at Xiang Zhuang, the would-be assassin whose job it had been to kill Liu Bang while entertaining the banqueters with a 몬sword dance.몭 몮Impudent boy! You don몭t even deserve my counsel!몯 Fan Zeng thundered. Everyone there knew very well who Fan Zeng몭s words were really meant for 멪 Xiang Yu himself. So, although Fan Zeng was a talented man, gifted with many kinds of wisdom, he lacked the wisdom to get along with Xiang Yu, which happened to be the most vital thing. It was the thing that he absolutely had to get right if he ever wanted to accomplish his ambitions on the world stage.
Why did events happen the way they did? It all comes down to a very human weakness: as close a relationship you may have with someone, there몭s naturally a corresponding build-up of resentment. 
Our relationships with enemies are very simple 멪 it몭s about a clash of interests, to be solved either by fighting or by negotiating. But close relationships of any kind are more complex, because they몭re full of strong emotions, spanning a broad range from love to hate. The relationship you have with your enemies is based on competition; this is a normal social mechanism. But, there is also internal competition between members of the same organization, because organizations are essentially mechanisms for competition and distribution of resources. The stratagem of dividing one몭s enemies is about external competitors crossing the boundaries of competition itself, and taking part in their enemy몭s internal competition. The results can be magic.
Castles always fall from the inside. If you don몭t want to fall prey to the stratagem of division, make sure your leader is broad-minded and of strong character. 
       


       
Stay alert, don몭t slack off

Cao Cao comments: 몮Attack where they are lax, appear where they are exposed.몯
There is a phrase coined by the ancient strategist Wu Qi: 몮When you step out of your door, act as though the enemy몭s in your yard.몯 It means that you should always be vigilant.
The Confucians also liked to talk about caution and fear: 몮Be cautious of what you cannot see, and be fearful of what you do not know.몯 Stay on the alert, and pay attention to things that you don몭t know, and things that you might not notice. The ancient Classic of Poetry says: 몮Tremble with fear, as though near the edge of an abyss, as though treading o몭er thin ice.몯
When I was in elementary and middle school, the school buildings had big slogans painted on them: 몬United 멪 Alert 멪  Earnest 멪 Active.몭 But what does the word 몬alert몭 really mean to school kids? In Chinese, the word used for 몬alert몭 in this case is also the word for 몬nervous,몭 so for us, we only knew this word as meaning the nervousness we felt when we were in the classroom. The origins of this slogan come from the school motto that Mao Zedong gave to the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan몭an during the war of resistance against Japan.
Leaders must always be paying attention. It몭s important to keep your people in a state of alertness 멪 if there is any sign that they몭re letting down their guard, you should immediately light a fire under them, because slacking off is a sure way to lose. This is especially true on the battlefield, where your enemy is constantly racking their brains, studying you to work out where you might be less than watertight. Beware of thinking that you can relax in a certain area just because there don몭t seem to be any problems there 멪 your enemy is probably already on to you.
Now, let몭s look at an example of this stratagem in action.
Cao Cao was preparing to launch a campaign against the nomadic Wuhuan people who lived in the far north, and his invasion strategy was drawn up by an advisor named Guo Jia. This was his advice: 몮The barbarians rely too much on the fact that they are far away, and I am certain they are not well prepared for an invasion. Because they will be unprepared, you should attack them suddenly and swiftly; this is how you can destroy them.몯
When Cao Cao몭s army had made it north of Yi, Guo Jia gave his lord another round of advice: 몮In war, speed is paramount; we have many miles to travel before we can reach within striking distance of our enemy; our supply carts are many and burdensome, and so it is difficult to put ourselves in a favourable position. It would be better to send out our light forces, and to travel by shortcuts so as to stay hidden and undetected by the enemy.몯
Cao Cao took Guo Jia몭s advice, and rode for Lulong Pass at the head of his light forces. Bearing directly down on the Wuhuan chieftain몭s court, they took the Wuhuan by surprise and totally destroyed them.
Another example of an effective surprise attack is the conquest of the city of Chengdu, in the final stages of the War of the Three Kingdoms, by General Deng Ai of the state of Wei. The two greatest generals of Wei, Deng Ai and Zhong Hui, together launched an attack on the kingdom of Shu (modern-day Sichuan). However, their progress was blocked at Sword Gate Pass, site of a Shu fortress guarded by General Jiang Wei. The invading Wei generals settled in to a lengthy siege, but they seemed unable to breach the fortress몭s defenses. So, Deng Ai came up with a different plan, which he explained to his comrade, Zhong Hui: 몮I know of a path that heads out of Yinping and around Sword Gate Pass. It is devilishly perilous, but I can use it to head west toward Chengdu and take the enemy unawares, striking them directly in the heart. Then, if the forces at Sword Gate Pass backtrack towards Fu County, you will be able to breach the fortress. And if they decide to stay in their fortress, there will be fewer of their forces to guard Fu County, and I will be able to swiftly capture the whole region.몯
It was the tenth month of the lunar calendar 멪 winter 멪 when Deng Ai set out on a journey of over 200 miles through uninhabited mountains. As they slowly moved through the treacherous terrain, they had to chisel paths out of sheer rock faces and build bridges across rivers. The mountains in that region are steep, and the valleys deep, and the men soon ran out of food. They were in grave danger. At one point, Deng Ai had to wrap himself in a roll of felt and roll down a mountain, and at other times he and his men had to march single-file, climbing trees and scaling cliffs. When they emerged from the mountains, it was as if they몭d fallen from the sky, coming out of nowhere and smashing through Shu몭s weak reserve forces all the way to Chengdu몭s city walls. Jiang Wei, along with the main Shu army, had stayed put in Sword Gate Pass, and so the Lord of Shu, Liu Chan, quickly surrendered.

Cao Cao comments: 몮Divulging information is the same as giving away your plans.몯
We have just talked about many different stratagems of deception, but one thing is essential if you want to successfully use any one of them: you cannot let anyone know about your plans. If your enemy finds out your plan, it becomes totally useless. But it몭s not just your enemy you need to keep in the dark. You can몭t let your own people know what you몭re planning either, because the more people know a secret, the more likely it becomes that it will leak.
The Warring States period philosophical text, the Han Feizi, says: 몮Success comes from watertight actions, failure comes from loose words.몯 In any bitter struggle, secret-keeping is of paramount importance.
If you had to pick the most exceptional example of secret-keeping from Chinese history, there몭d be no better choice than Modun, the Xiongnu chieftain discussed in an earlier chapter, who we last saw soliciting the widowed Empress Wu for her hand in marriage. What was his secret? As a young man, he plotted to commit treason against his own father, who he indeed ended up killing, installing himself as the new chieftain.
Although Modun was the crown prince, his father, Touman, fell in love with a concubine and fathered another son, and decided to pass the throne to his beloved concubine몭s son instead of to Modun. Then, Touman formed an alliance with the Yuezhi people and gave them Modun as a hostage. Not long after, Touman attacked the Yuezhi, hoping that the Yuezhi would kill Modun, doing his dirty work for him.
But in a twist of events, Modun managed to steal a horse and escape back home. His bravery was apparently enough to win back his father몭s affections, and Touman forgot all about his plans to kill him. But Modun didn몭t forget. He knew all about his father몭s plot, and set his mind on killing his father, the concubine and his young half-brother.
Conspiring against the state is serious business; it몭s not something that one person can pull off alone. It몭s vital to work with partners, and naturally this involves talking things through with other people. This stage is when the risk of failure is at its highest, because once you몭ve told someone what you몭re planning, there몭s no way out for them, and no way of staying uninvolved. They have two choices: either stake their life on fighting alongside you, to the death, or immediately sell you out. For example, the Hundred Day Reform movement that attempted to modernize Qing dynasty China at the end of the 19th century failed partly because one of the reformers, Tan Sitong, forced the powerful warlord Yuan Shikai몭s hand. Yuan then joined the other side 멪 the anti-reform Empress Dowager Cixi.
But there are always exceptions. Modun became the only person in the history of China to accomplish a coup all alone, without telling a soul what he was planning.
The way Modun did it was by training his men to give conditioned responses, just like Pavlov몭s dog. 
First, Modun personally made a special kind of arrow that whistles loudly as it flies through the air. Then, he conditioned his men to immediately shoot whenever he fired his whistling arrow, and to aim in whichever direction the whistling arrow was flying. Any man who hesitated or delayed for even a second was immediately beheaded.
After training his men for a while, one day Modun suddenly shot his whistling arrow towards his favorite horse. Some of his men hesitated, unsure if Modun had really meant to order them to kill his horse. Too slow 멪 all of these men were beheaded, and everyone else was left in no doubt that Modun was not joking around.
Another day, Modun suddenly fired towards his most beloved concubine. Again, some of his men hesitated, and were immediately hauled away and beheaded. 
On the third occasion, Modun fired towards his father몭s horse. This time, his men immediately fired a single volley at the horse. None of them had thought twice. Modun knew that his conditioning work was finished; he was ready to make his move.
The time came when Modun was out hunting with his father. He suddenly shot his whistling arrow towards his father, and his men, without time to think about what they were doing, immediately became accomplices in their chieftain몭s murder. Modun몭s plan had worked, and he went on to become the first truly powerful chieftain in the history of the Xiongnu Empire. His military might was the reason why the Han dynasty Emperors avoided confrontation, instead managing the Xiongnu threat with a policy of marrying Chinese princesses to Xiongnu chieftains.


	
There몭s nothing difficult about The Thirty-Six Stratagems, yet people get very excited about it. Meanwhile, the Five Factors and Seven Considerations are highly complex, but the mere mention of them sends people to sleep!

Extract from the original text:
몮Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.몯

Analysis:
Li Quan comments: 몮The divine commander shuns donning armor in favor of making calculations; 몬Many calculations몭 refers to sixty calculations or more, while 몬few calculations몭 refers to less than sixty calculations.몯 If you make more calculations than the enemy, victory is yours, and vice versa. This is why, if you properly carry out calculations in the temple before going to war, the outcome is easy to predict. The side that makes more calculations will win. If you have made more calculations, you can go out and fight, but if you몭ve made less, you need to exercise caution, think things through thoroughly, and spend more time preparing. If the odds are totally against you, don몭t even think about going out to fight.
And with that, we have reached the end of the first chapter of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War 멪 몬Calculations.몭 As we have seen, the bulk of its content is divided between two themes: the 몬Five Factors and Seven Considerations,몭 and the 몬Twelve Ways of Deception.몭 The former is the foundation; it represents strategy and the real balance of power.
To recap, the 몬Five Factors몭 are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; and (5) Method and Discipline. They몭re about comparing yourself and the enemy in terms of each of these, which is done by calculating the answers to the questions posed in 몬the Seven Considerations.몭 These are: (1) Which of the two kings is imbued with the Moral Law? (2) Which of the two generals has the most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater consistency both in reward and punishment?
This is what the art of war is all about; calculating the outcome using the tools provided by the 몬Five Factors and Seven Considerations.몭 You only fight after you몭ve already won, which means that if the odds aren몭t firmly in your favor, don몭t fight. Instead, bide your time, build your strength, and keep on preparing. When I say 몬preparing,몭 I mean preparing in a way that boosts your score in the calculations of the 몬Five Factors and Seven Considerations,몭 because, again, these are the foundations of the art of war. Win first, fight later. Win while you몭re still in the temple doing your calculations, summon your generals and mobilize your armies. March to the battlefield and watch the result reveal itself.
Once you are on the battlefield, the dictum that 몬The art of war is the way of deception몭 becomes true. At this point, it becomes more about unleashing the 몬Twelve ways of deception,몭 and 몬using a multitude of diverse methods to fool one몭s foe.몭 When able, seem unable; when using your forces, seem inactive; when near, make the enemy believe you are far away; when far away, make him believe you are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy, spreading disorder. Then, crush him. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is quick to anger, irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. Attack him where he is unprepared, and appear where you are not expected.
These 몬Twelve Ways of Deception몭 are pretty much the same as the Thirty-Six Stratagems. They몭re cunning tricks and fancy maneuvers that prove drool-inducing for so many people who like to fantasize about using them to achieve lightning-fast gains. They몭re irresistible to those who expect to make something out of nothing.
But, the fundamentals are never about flashy tricks, no matter what you몭re trying to achieve. It may be true that Liu Bang used many cunning ruses to bamboozle his way to victory over Xiang Yu, but the overarching structure of his success was still built on the foundation of the 몬Five Factors and Seven Considerations.몭 We see this throughout his career, from his merciful sparing of the people of Qin, to the simple new law code that he instituted. It was Liu Bang몭s political actions that really propelled him miles ahead of Xiang Yu.
China몭s all-time most famous practitioner of ingenious tricks was Zhuge Liang, and the stories about him have become part of the fabric of Chinese culture. Yet, he ultimately didn몭t win. The reason was that the odds of victory and the arithmetic of the 몬Five Factors and Seven Considerations몭 were never really on his side. That몭s why I fully agree with his rival, Sima Yi, who condemned him as 몮Trying to force his way against the currents of Heaven.몯 Here, 몬Heaven몭 is a stand-in for the 몬Five Factors and Seven Considerations.몭
It몭s the same in business management. Don몭t waste your time thinking about fancy maneuvers. Instead, get the basics right: products and service.
The truth is that the 몬Ways of Deception몭 are not at all difficult 멪 there aren몭t many of them, and the main skill in using them is putting on a convincing show. 몬The Five Factors and Seven Considerations,몭 by contrast, are extremely complex, demanding strength of character, wisdom, sweat, time and accumulation. Their relative difficulty explains why people love to hear about the Thirty-Six Stratagems, but not so much about the 몬Five Factors and Seven Considerations.몭



Appendix: Complete text of Calculations

Sun Tzu said: 몮The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence, it is a subject of inquiry that can on no account be neglected. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one몭s deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions in the field. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; and (5) Method and Discipline. The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger. Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons. Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death. The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness. By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this way: (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? (2) Which of the two generals has most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment? By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat. The general that hearkens to my counsel, and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens not to my counsel, nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat: let such a one be dismissed! While heeding the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules. Accordingly, as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one몭s plans. All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy, spreading disorder. Then, crush him. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand. Now, the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.몯




Chapter Two
Waging War

War is about money and grain, not soldiers and horses

Extract from the original text:
몮In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand sets of armor, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand gold pieces per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.몯

Analysis:
To start off the new chapter, Waging War, here몭s some commentary from Cao Cao: 몮If one desires to wage war, one must first calculate the expense, and determine whether grain can be seized from one몭s enemy.몯
Another comment, by Zhang Yu, addresses the logical order of steps to be taken: 몮The calculations being in order, prepare for war: calculate, in the following order, the costs of readying chariots and horses, procuring good equipment, and transporting grain and fodder.몯 You need to have a budget.
The 몬swift chariots몭 Sun Tzu refers to were war chariots, each pulled by four horses. When Sun Tzu was alive, stirrups had not yet been invented, making it too precarious for men on horseback to fight at close quarters. This meant there were no horseback soldiers, only war chariots. Each war chariot would carry three armored soldiers, and was backed up by 72 foot soldiers following closely behind, according to The Methods of Sima. Ancient Chinese war chariots were used in more or less the same way as tanks in modern warfare.
One war chariot represents 75 soldiers. In Chinese history books, a common phrase is 몬a country of a thousand chariots,몭 which is actually a practical measure of a country몭s military might. In meant that the country in question possesses 1,000 war chariots, equaling 75,000 soldiers in total.
Meanwhile, 몬heavy chariots몭 refers to supply carts, which would be loaded with everything from food rations and cooking equipment to weapons, armor, clothes, etc. Each heavy chariot would carry 25 men: ten cooks, five attendants, five horse grooms, and five laborers whose job it was to chop wood and fetch water. With 1,000 heavy chariots, the number of extra men adds up to 25,000. Together with the men assigned to light chariots, this adds up to army of 100,000 men, also explaining the arithmetic behind 몬a hundred thousand sets of armor.몭
This is definitely a lot of men to account for, but then you have to wrap your head around somehow procuring 몬provisions enough to carry them a thousand li!몭 Transporting food was a seriously important part of warfare in ancient China. For example, suppose you몭re planning an expedition to attack the Xiongnu. With ten carts of grain, you몭ll only have two left to feed your army once they reach the front line. Why? Because four carts worth will have been eaten on the way, and you몭ll need to save another four for the journey back. Each leg of a journey into Xiongnu territory might take several long months, and without enough food, your army will starve to death by the roadside. The figure I gave is actually on the high side. In Li Quan몭s commentary, he calculated that transporting an army몭s grain a distance of 1,000 li would require the labor of twenty extra men just to feed one soldier. That means twenty more sets of rations!
Then there are the other costs: hosting and entertaining messengers and emissaries, repairing and maintaining chariots, armor, weapons and other equipment, acquiring materials to make glue and paint, etc. And, logistically, the supplies get sent out before the troops. The money adds up very quickly indeed 멪 for an army of 100,000, the daily operational costs would amount to 1,000 gold pieces.
The second chapter of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War moves on from the questions of calculating balances of power, odds of victory and risk factors discussed in the first chapter, and sets its sights on costs, budgeting and safeguarding resources. The principles are exactly the same as in modern-day business operations.



The great Han Wudi: Hero of a generation, undone by military spending

Extract from the original text:
몮When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men몭s weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.몯

Analysis:
Let몭s look at some commentary by Jia Lin: 몮Though you may defeat your enemy, there is no benefit to victory which is long in coming. What is important in war is total victory. If your men몭s weapons grow dull and their ardor dampened, and if your troops are wounded and your horses exhausted, then you will be subjugated.몯
The aim of fighting wars is to gain some kind of benefit, but if the fighting takes too long, you몭ll burn through too many resources and whatever gains you make won몭t balance your losses.
In Sun Tzu몭s words, 몮If the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.몯 In short, long wars can really bring a country to its knees. In the story of the Great Emperor Wu of Han (Han Wudi), there is a profound lesson to be learned. 
In modern-day China, Han Wudi (141-87 BCE) figures large in history textbooks, movies and TV shows. His image is one of imposing power. Yet, in reality, he not only bankrupted the imperial government, he also impoverished the entire population of the country he ruled. Such was his appetite for war that even a country as enormous as China could be pushed to the brink of ruin under his governance. 
But, Han Wudi몭s example also reveals the greatness of Sun Tzu 멪 he didn몭t try to leverage his status as a military expert to falsely convince the lords to whom he offered his services to fight more wars, even though doing so would have boosted his own career. He did the opposite, going to great lengths to convince the men he advised not to fight, because he was both truly wise and truly benevolent. Sun Tzu was a man with a strong sense of responsibility, if ever there was one.
Humans, by nature, love the idea of achieving great things. This is a weakness, one that is by no means reserved for Emperors and rulers. Ordinary people are broken down into cannon fodder by the thousands, and even as people몭s kin are killed and their families torn apart, still they hero-worship the rulers who are so infatuated with their own greatness. In China, the reign of Han Wudi is described using the euphemistic phrase, 몬A time of flourishing,몭 whereas the reign of his father, Emperor Wenjing, was written up in the history books as 몬An age of peace.몭 All periods of history that we might call 몬the good times몭 are described as one or the other: 몬time of flourishing,몭 or 몬age of peace.몭 However, people only really get excited about the 몬times of flourishing,몭 apparently unaware that the only time people could enjoy life in what could accurately be called a 몬paradise on earth몭 was during times of peace. Meanwhile, if you live through a 몬time of flourishing,몭 you are likely to lose friends and family members, or maybe even be fed to the cannons yourself, to become part of the songs of nostalgic poets in some later era.
What exactly is an 몬age of peace?몭 Basically, they were periods of recovery and regeneration. Also, taxes were very low, often in the realm of 3%. There were no tariffs on trade, or tolls for highways and bridges. People were free to invest in private business, and almost all businesses were on top of their debts. Business freedom extended to traditional monopoly industries: manufacturing salt by boiling seawater, mining, smelting iron, and even manufacturing copper money. The overall situation was the same as in modern, economically liberal countries, including the freedom for private banks to issue currency.
It was this kind of golden age that Emperor Wenjing ruled over, as well as Emperor Taizong of Tang during his Zhenguan reign period. In simple terms, these were times of freedom, when society governed itself, when government was small and didn몭t interfere in the people몭s economic and cultural life. You could do anything, as long as it wasn몭t illegal. In any case, very few things were illegal; there were perhaps just a few more laws than the three that Liu Bang famously made into his entire legal framework.
These were times of regeneration, when people몭s energy and dynamism were released in unprecedented ways, and society몭s wealth exploded. By the time Han Wudi inherited the throne from his father, Wenjing, at the end of the golden age, the state treasury and granaries were full to bursting. The historical annals tell how the string traditionally used to tie up stacks of money was worn and frayed, and that the government struggled to find enough things to spend money on.
몮Make it clear to any who would commit crime against the great Han court, that no matter how far they flee, they will always be caught, and executed.몯 This pronouncement, first spoken by a Han dynasty general, is being used in our current era by passionate, nationalistic young people. It inspires passion and fervor. But what these modern young people don몭t know is that there is another story lurking behind this warning. It몭s a tale of how a country몭s government and people fell into an abyss of bankruptcy.
Han Wudi sent his armies out to fight year after year, constantly expanding the empire몭s borders into new lands. Before long, the treasury was nearly empty, so he started up what was effectively a state-owned enterprise, based on the so-called 몬salt and iron theory.몭 What was the rationale? Salt was a daily necessity for every family in the empire, so production should be reserved exclusively for the central government. No private salt businesses were allowed. Likewise, every rural family needed metal tools 멪 scythes, hoes and the like. So, the same principle would be applied to the business of mining and smelting iron.
As such, the Chinese people몭s livelihood was now monopolized by the state, marking the rise of the 몬secondary-industry taxation system,몭 which was first devised hundreds of years prior by a politician named Guanzi in the Warring States period state of Qi. To this very day in China, food-grade salt is still monopolized by the government.
Even with the extra revenue from the monopolies, Han Wudi soon found himself without enough money for his projects. He began to increase tax rates at random, and once the tax increases became truly unsustainable, he began taxing people몭s accumulated wealth, demanding that everyone of middle-class background or higher must declare their wealth and assets to the government. Of course, no one wanted to do this, so a lot of people either didn몭t file a declaration or under-reported. Han Wudi responded by ordering people to report their tax-dodging neighbors and friends to the government, and he threw in a big incentive: the informer would get half of their victim몭s wealth!
Pandora몭s box was now well and truly open. People falsely reported one another, officials ran extortion rackets, and innocent people were accused of giving false reports. Ultimately, the moneyed classes of China were bankrupted.
By the end of Han Wudi몭s reign, the country couldn몭t take much more. Under unprecedented political pressure, the Emperor wrote a self-criticism addressed to the entire nation:
몮Since the time when I ascended the throne, I have engaged in many wanton acts, and have caused distress to all under heaven. It is now too late for regret. Starting from today, there will be a halt to all activities being detrimental to the common folk and squandering the resources of all under heaven.몯
This was the first written record in China몭s history of a monarch blaming himself for anything.



몬Haste is stupid몭 멪 prepare slowly, act quickly 

Extract from the original text:
몮Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.몯

Analysis:
When war is dragged out too long, there are bound to be problems both in the rear and with your alliances. When your troops are tired and morale is low, when the bank is nearly empty, that is the time when your underlings 멪 the feudal lords 멪 will take advantage of your crisis and attack. When that time comes, no amount of wisdom or craftiness will save you; your hands will be tied. That몭s why you only hear about solid, well-prepared armies winning wars quickly, and also why you never see effective stratagems resulting in drawn-out conflicts.
We have a classic historical lesson to chew on, courtesy of Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty, a man who had a very similar temperament to Han Wudi. He was highly competent, extremely intelligent, and equally in his element governing the state and leading war campaigns. As if fulfilling the Chinese idiom, 몬The abler one is, the more one should do,몭 he decreed his reign title would be 몬Great Undertaking.몭 He had big plans.
It was Emperor Yang who dug the Grand Canal 멪 at 1,776 km, the longest artificial river in the world 멪 benefitting countless generations. If the only thing he did was to create the Grand Canal, eternal glory and a glittering place in the history books would have been his. But human life is hard and short, and he was intent on using all his strength to achieve as many great deeds as possible. So, he moved the capital to Luoyang, building it into a new 몬Eastern Capital,몭 personally led an invasion of the nomadic Tuyuhun people몭s territories, and invaded the Korean state of Goguryeo not once, but three times. All of this left the treasury empty and the people of China impoverished, and heralded a time of universal misery. He also ordered the building of ships, which he wanted completed so quickly that the shipbuilders apparently developed festering sores on their feet because they spent so much time standing in water.
Soon, rebellious champions of the people rose up, like Yang Xiangan and Li Mi, and China fell once again into chaos. It wasn몭t long before Emperor Yang lost his head.
This chapter of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War was originally written for King Helu of the state of Wu, and yet, ironically, Helu became an anti-example during the 몬Mulberry Leaf War몭 between Wu and its old enemy, the state of Chu. I named the war myself 멪 it started near the border between Chu and Wu, with two girls who both wanted to pick the leaves from a certain mulberry tree. They started arguing, and maybe even hit each other. Then, the parents got involved. Apparently, everyone was a little short-tempered, and began fighting each other. People were killed, and the border defense forces of both states mobilized. In the end, the situation spiraled into a full-blown war.
By the end of the war, the Wu army occupied the Chu capital, the city of Ying, and King Zhao of Chu fled into exile. This was the first time in the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE) that the capital city of a feudal vassal state had been occupied by external forces.
How exciting for the victorious King Helu! He stayed in Ying for a long time, terrorizing the people and enriching himself. As time passed, the King of Yue realized that the Wu army was still in Chu, and had left Wu unguarded. The Yue King seized his chance and launched an attack on Wu. At the same time, the self-exiled King Zhao of Chu returned from Qin at the head of an army. King Helu weakened himself fighting the Qin army, and his younger brother, Fugai, decided that the time was now right for him to make his own move. He secretly returned home to Wu and installed himself as the new king.
Helu rushed home to Wu to deal with his brother몭s rebellion, which he eventually succeeded in, for better or for worse. The defeated Fugai led his men to Chu, where he surrendered and turned himself over to King Zhao.
Helu, despite having already won a victory of an unprecedented scale when he first invaded Chu, did not know how to quit while he was ahead. Instead, he ended up seriously weakened, and nearly destroyed, all for no benefit to himself. If there was nothing in it for him, then why did he want to fight a war in the first place? The reason is simply that people always seem to forget why they몭re doing things once they몭re in the middle of doing them.
몮Though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.몯 Clever things are fleeting; they never last long. It몭s like fashion: fashionable clothes can only be worn for a season, and the most exquisite pieces of high fashion can only be worn once, and yet a normal shirt can be worn for years.
Zeng Guofan had his own understanding of 몬stupid haste.몭 He saw it as 몬Hurrying when there is no rush.몭 In terms of both strategy and the paths we walk through life, if you do things properly, practice steady accumulation, and move forward little by little, day by day, after 20 years you will be in all likelihood ahead of the pack. The real work gets done in daily life; it몭s about fundamentals.
When it comes to fighting wars, avoiding 몬stupid haste몭 is about preparing slowly and acting quickly. This is the essence of Communist Party General Lin Biao몭s famous strategy of 몬Four swifts, one slow.몭
	The 몬four swifts몭 are:
1) Swiftly advance on the enemy. When attacking, you must be skilled at doing what the enemy does not expect; launch long-range attacks over great distances, and you will hold the enemy firmly in your grip.
2)  Swiftly carry out preparations before attacking. Once the enemy is within your grip, evaluate the terrain and select a point of attack where you can break through the enemy line. Position your troops and guns, and carry out construction and engineering works. Readying troops for battle, and all other preparations and arrangements, must be swiftly carried out.
3) Swiftly expand on any gains you make. After breaking through the enemy line, resolutely expand the 몬breakthrough point.몭 This will render enemy forces unable to restore their defenses.
4) Swiftly pursue and strike when the enemy retreats. After enemy forces collapse and retreat, you must be ferocious; pursue them until your task is complete. This will render the enemy unable to escape, regroup, or continue to resist you.
Lin Biao몭s 몬one slow몭 is the idea of carrying out your general offensive slowly. It몭s about first gaining a clear picture of the enemy몭s position and the terrain, selecting a point of attack, and effectively positioning your troops and guns. Prepare thoroughly, and only then launch your offensive.
Lin Biao몭s formula, 몬The four swifts and the one slow,몭 is the best possible commentary and clarification of Sun Tzu몭s idea that 몬haste is stupid.몭



The benefit-danger connection: First consider how to avoid danger, then consider how to obtain benefit

Extract from the original text:
몮There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the dangers of war that can thoroughly understand the beneficial way of carrying it on.몯

Analysis:
Gu Lin offers this comment: 몮Prolonged war accomplishes nothing, except to give ideas to local power-holders.몯
Du You comments: 몮When war is prolonged and sharp weapons remain drawn, things change. Consider, for example, when Zhi Bo surrounded Zhao. For years he did not relent, and in the end his soldiers were captured by Xiangzi; Wei Po was killed, and his country divided.몯
Zhi Bo was a member of the Zhi clan, one of the four great families of the state of Jin during the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE). He also held an official post in the Jin government. The other three families were the Han, Zhao and Wei families, but the Zhi family was the strongest. Zhi Bo approached the Han and Wei families and demanded land from them. Both families responded strategically, happily handed over their land and acting submissively so as to make the enemy overly confident. They knew that if they refused to give Zhi Bo their land, they몭d be dragged into a fight that they couldn몭t win. They also knew that if they gave him their land, he would keep making demands of other people, and the number of his enemies would increase.
Zhi Bo was pleased that he몭d gotten what he wanted, and he soon demanded more land from Zhao Xiangzi. But he didn몭t want just any land 멪 he was asking the Zhao family to hand over its best parcel, and more to the point, this piece of land included the Zhao family ancestral temple. There was no way the Zhao family would give it up. It was at this moment that war broke out.
Zhi Bo coerced the Han and Wei families to fight on his side, promising that once the Zhao family had been wiped out, he would give them part of the newly conquered land. The war lasted for three years, after which the Zhao family could no longer support its war effort. They sent messengers to the Han and Wei families, with this proposition: 몮We all know what kind of man Zhi Bo is; there is no chance he will give you any land. He will attack each of us until we are all ruined. The best thing for us to do would be to join hands and destroy the Zhi family. Then, we can split their land between us.몯
This was the moment the Han and Wei families had been waiting for. They sent a messenger to tell the Zhao family that they몭d been on the same page all along, and were prepared to fall into step. Not long after, though, they turned their troops around and attacked Zhi Bo, taking him by surprise and killing him in the fight. After the war, the three victorious families not only shared the Zhi family몭s land between them, they also deposed the Duke of Jin. They split the state of Jin into three new states 멪 Han, Zhao and Wei 멪 which became three out of the seven states that remained contenders at the start of the Warring States period.
Zhi Bo was very talented, both as a military commander and a man of learning. When you also consider that he was an official in the Jin government, his political and economic strength was far superior to that of the three other great families. If only he had waited for the right moment before attacking Zhao. If he몭d prepared properly and launched a swift, well-coordinated attack, he may well have succeeded. He might have vanquished the three other families, and the state of Jin might have become the state of Zhi rather than the states of Han, Wei and Zhao. But, long wars only bring trouble, and so, instead, Zhi Bo met with an ignoble end. His skull was painted and turned into a wine cup by Zhao Xiangzi, who apparently hated Zhi Bo so deeply that the only way he could process his hate was by drinking wine from Zhi Bo몭s skull on a daily basis.
 
몮It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the dangers of war that can thoroughly understand the beneficial way of carrying it on.몯

Li Quan comments: 몮Benefit and danger are entwined within each other. When you know the dangers of doing something, then you also know the benefits.몯
So, anyone who doesn몭t fully understand the dangerous side of war also cannot understand its beneficial side. In the words of billionaire Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing, 몮Before you do anything, first think about failing.몯
Running a business is the same as fighting a war; they are both games of fine margins, with dangers pressing in on all sides. Actually, the chances of success in business are generally about ten times lower than in war, because in war there are only two sides 멪 if one side loses, the other side wins. Meanwhile, in business, you don몭t know who you몭re fighting against and anything could happen. There몭s no use acting innocent and asking, 몬How could this happen?몭 People shouldn몭t think that when they몭re successful it몭s all because of their own greatness, and when they fail it몭s because of 몬shifting circumstances.몭 Circumstances are under no obligation to wait for you; you have to prioritize avoiding danger, and only then can you obtain benefits. This way, even if you can몭t obtain the benefit you want today, you몭ll still be able to try again tomorrow. But, if you don몭t avoid danger, you lose your capital and end up forced out of the contest. This is why avoiding danger is so much more important than obtaining benefits.
So why, then, are we a hundred times more conscious of obtaining benefits than we are of avoiding danger? Mainly, it몭s because we tend to trust in our own luck enough that we몭re willing to gamble. People often repeat the idea that, at worst, you can always try again. But not everyone is destined to be a successful entrepreneur. Once you몭re out of the game you might not have the chance to get back into it, because the other players will never give their cards away for nothing. If you have no cards in your hand, how will you get back in the game?

Lower your war expenses, increase your odds of victory

Extract from the original text:
몮Those skilled in war do not raise a second levy, neither are their supply-wagons loaded three times. Bring war material with you from home, but procure your food from the enemy. Thus, the army will have provisions enough for its needs.  A state, and its common people, can be impoverished by a commander who transports supplies over great distances. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up, and high prices cause the people몭s substance to be drained away. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.몯

Analysis:
몬Not raising a second levy몭 means that a commander should raise enough troops to solve whatever problem his war is supposed to solve, without running out of soldiers halfway through and having to return home to enlist more men. But, the more difficult part is 몬not loading the supply-wagons three times,몭 or, in other words, loading them only twice. This means taking one load of rations with you on the way to battle, and having a second load sent to you for your army to eat on the road back home. And what about the time in between? What should the army eat when they몭re not on the march? This is the part where you 몬procure your food from the enemy.몭 If you can defeat the enemy and seize their cities, you can take their stored supplies and avoid having to transport food from your own country. At the start of the wars between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, Liu Bang had already gotten hold of the state granaries left behind by the defunct Qin dynasty. While Xiang Yu몭s men groaned with hunger, Liu Bang몭s troops never once had to worry about having food to eat and clothes to keep them warm.
When you set out to do something, do it right the first time; the most efficient way to do a job is to not do it twice. This is a principle that seems to apply to everything people do, not just war.

몮A state, and its common people, can be impoverished by a commander who transports supplies over great distances.몯

Du Mu comments that food is heavy; to transport food, you need people as well as oxen to pull the carts. If the farmers몭 plow-oxen are all taken away from the farms, the farmers won몭t be able to plow their fields, and the common people will be forced into poverty.
The Warring States period politician, Guanzi, said: 몮When grain is transported a distance of three hundred li, the country will be deprived of a year몭s worth of grain stores. If the distance is four hundred li, the country will be deprived of two years몭 worth of grain stores. If the distance is four hundred li, then the people will suffer famine.몯 So, each time Zhuge Liang set out on one of his expeditions to the north, he would first have to save up three years몭 worth of grain. His enemy, the state of Wei, was well aware of his food situation, so they were able to predict the timing of his next invasion. Each time he attacked, they stayed safely behind the high walls of their fortresses and waited until he ran out of food and was forced to head back home. Whatever clever stratagems Zhuge Liang had in store, his enemies had already used methods of calculation to figure him out. During Zhuge Liang몭s final attempt, at the Wuzhang Plain, he sent women몭s clothing to humiliate Sima Yi, but Sima Yi refused to be drawn into a fight, and ultimately Zhuge Liang tired himself to death. 

몮The proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people몭s substance to be drained away.몯

When an army sets up camp, the sudden influx of large numbers of soldiers can cause prices to soar in the surrounding area, especially in the case of a siege. During the time of the Qing dynasty Taiping Heavenly Kingdom rebellion, the Qing imperial army set up two large camps around the rebellious city of Nanjing 멪 one camp north of the Yangtze River, the other one south of the river 멪 in a siege that lasted for several long years. There was a great boom in business for the nearby teahouses, taverns and brothels, and in general, prices skyrocketed. This hit the local people hard because, although the prices had increased, the amount of money in their pockets had not.

몮When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions.몯

몬Exactions몭 refers to the military conscription system invented by Duke Cheng of Lu during the Spring and Autumn period, known as the qiuyi system. Zhang Yu comments: 몮If the country몭s needs are urgent, then procure from each qiu the contribution ordinarily made by each dian.몯 What this means is that taxes would effectively be quadrupled! Let몭s break down the numbers:
 From the most ancient times, military conscription in Chinese states had been based on calculations of land area and numbers of people living there. The Methods of the Sima contains details about the units used to measure land and the numbers of people living on that land: 몮Six chi equal one bu; a hundred bu equal one mu; a hundred mu equal one fu; three fu equal one wu; three wu equal one jing; four jing equal one yi; four yi equal one qiu; four qiu equal one dian.몯
The basic unit of land used for calculating military conscription was the dian. Every dian had to contribute a war chariot as well as four war horses, three armored soldiers, 72 ordinary foot soldiers and 16 oxen. 
Thanks to this system, we can calculate a country몭s overall strength by the size of its army. For example, I already mentioned the concept of 몬a country of a thousand mounts,몭 which means that the country in question has 1,000 war chariots and 75,000 soldiers. Using the qiujia system, we can calculate that this country몭s territory spans 1,000 dian, meaning that it has roughly 1,000 towns.
So, what did Duke Cheng of Lu do to change the old system? As soon as he came to power, he introduced his new qiuyi system. The numbers stayed the same: one war chariot, four war horses, three armored soldiers, 72 ordinary foot soldiers and 16 oxen. But previously, there had been one important difference: the required contribution by each dian, but now each qiu had to make the same contribution. There are four qiu in a dian, so this move meant that the requirement had quadrupled. This is why Duke Cheng has been roundly accused of recklessness, and even of being hell-bent on ruining his country.
Expense accounting is a topic that The Art of War repeatedly comes back to, because Sun Tzu wanted to emphasize just how expensive all the working parts of war are 멪 men, horses, oxen and grain all carry a high price tag. When war몭s operating costs are so high, it can easily become unaffordable.
But, what if we think about it from the opposite perspective? If there was a way of drastically shrinking just one of the main costs, wouldn몭t that make you unstoppable? One constant in war, as in business, is that the side with lower costs always beats the side with higher costs.
One person who realized this revolutionary idea was Napoleon Bonaparte, and he used it to usher in a new era in military history 멪 the age of the 몬People몭s War.몭 The main cost-saver of the People몭s War was in reducing the price of a human life.  Because of this, Napoleon didn몭t have to worry about suffering casualties, nor about the commandment to not 몬raise a second levy.몭 Not only could he raise an unlimited number of regular soldiers, he also had other resources to throw into the fray: units of child soldiers and women. Napoleon once proudly stated: 몮Now human life is even cheaper than dust!몯 He also boasted that he could afford to sacrifice 30,000 people per month. Meanwhile, the monarchs of other European countries still relied on the aristocracy to lead their armies and paid professional soldiers. The price gap between them and Napoleon몭s People몭s Army was enormous. Another advantage of People몭s War is that it reduces the cost of resources, by pouring a country몭s entire resources into the war effort.
One leader took the ideas of both Sun Tzu and Napoleon to their pinnacle. That leader was Mao Zedong.



If you몭ve never run a household, you can몭t understand the value of the daily necessities7; If you don몭t know the value of daily necessities, you can몭t run a household

Extract from the original text:
몮With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and seven-tenths of their income will be dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breastplates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons will amount to six-tenths of its total revenue. Hence, a wise general makes a point of obtaining food from the enemy. One zhong of the enemy몭s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one몭s own, and likewise a single picul of his fodder is equivalent to twenty from one몭s own store.몯

Analysis:
A war that drags incessantly on saps both strength and finances. Long wars bankrupt everyone, from the government to the common people. The people who live on the plains have to give food for the soldiers and transport it themselves, so both their wealth and their labor is conscripted for the war effort, leaving their houses stripped of seven-tenths of what they own.
Just the weapons and goods mentioned in the passage above cost six-tenths of the government몭s revenue, and this is before food has been accounted for. That몭s why a wise general will always think of a way to eat from the enemy몭s plate 멪 몮One zhong of the enemy몭s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one몭s own.몯
The words 몬zhong몭 and 몬picul몭 are both ancient Chinese units of measurement. One picul equals ten dou, and since Zhang Yu explains in his commentary that one picul is also equal to 120 jin (a commonly used unit in China today, about 0.5 kilograms), we can see that one dou equals 12 jin. One zhong, according to Du Mu, is equal to six piculs and four dou, or 778 jin.
Let몭s calculate the basis of Sun Tzu몭s statement: 몮One zhong of the enemy몭s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one몭s own.몯 Basically, you have to use 20 zhong of food in the process of having people transport one zhong of food to the front line. You need oxen and wagons to transport food over long distances, but oxen walk much more slowly than humans. You also need human labor in the form of workers, and an armed escort to protect the wagons. If you send out a grain[bd11] convoy with 21,000 zhong of grain, 13,000 zhong gets eaten on the road by the transport team. Once the convoy reaches the front line, only 1,000 zhong is handed over to the army, with the remaining 7,000 being the minimum amount needed to feed the transport team on their way back without them starving to death. And there몭s your answer!
Everyone has to eat 멪 and not just people, but horses and oxen too. The animals that pull the grain wagons also have to pull enough fodder for themselves to eat on both legs of their journey. Here, 몬fodder몭 includes soybean stalks, which are famously featured in the Seven Steps Verse, a poem written by Cao Cao몭s son, Cao Zhi: 몮People burn the beanstalk to boil beans.몯 몬Fodder몭 also includes straw from cereal crops. The same principle of 몬One zhong of the enemy몭s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one몭s own몭 also applies to animal fodder.
When the Qin dynasty generals invaded the Xiongnu territories and ordered people all over China to send food, the efficiency of food transport was much worse. A wagon setting out from Shandong with 30 zhong of food would only be carrying one picul by the time it reached the front lines, equivalent to just one two-hundredths of its original load! Clearly, relying on human laborers and beasts of burden to transport food takes a long time, and it몭s very inefficient. There was similarly low efficiency in grain delivery when Han Wudi launched his conquest of the southwestern Yi people. He conscripted tens of thousands of people to run the transport convoys, and each picul of food delivered came at a cost of over a dozen zhong, an efficiency rate hovering near 1%. So, Sun Tzu몭s figure of 몬one in twenty몭 was favourable in comparison. The reason Sun Tzu몭s figure was relatively low was because it was based on his experience in wars between Chinese states during the Spring and Autumn period, which took place over relatively flat land in areas that were already developed. However, later expeditions against the Xiongnu and the Southwest Yi had to cross large mountain ranges and tracts of barren land, so naturally the cost of transport was higher.
When Japan invaded China in the 20th century, they first captured China몭s northeast, closely followed by Zhejiang Province (the area around Shanghai.) This gave the Japanese supply bases in China. If the Japanese army had been forced to transport all of their food from Japan, they wouldn몭t have been able to support their invasion. This is why China몭s determination not to surrender, as well as its success in stalling the Japanese, qualifies China to be recognized as one of the four major victors of World War II. 
Genghis Khan conquered the world, and part of his success was that he was unmatched in his ability to drive down food costs. His people were nomads, herding sheep and cows across the grasslands. Every day, their animals gave them fresh milk, as well as meat, and the fact that sheep and cows can give birth while on the move gave Genghis Khan몭s armies independence. They could set out on campaigns, accompanied by livestock, without having to rely on supplies sent from home. Once they reached the front lines, they could take more food from their enemies each time they captured a city. These are the crucial elements behind Genghis Khan몭s ability to reach across such vast distances. He put into practice Sun Tzu몭s commandment: 몮Those skilled in war do not raise a second levy, neither are their supply-wagons loaded three times.몯


Fury and bounty: Turn your soldiers into willing desperados

Extract from the original text:
몮Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards.몯

Analysis:
When you send an army to war, you have to give the soldiers a reason to kill the enemy. You have to turn each and every one of them into a wrathful killer, a willing desperado. This is about using people몭s emotions. There are two kinds of emotion that can make people forget about mortal danger: (1) Anger. When anger fills a person, they don몭t care about anything; and (2) Greed. People are willing to die for money.
Let몭s start with anger.
Du Mu comments: 몮Ten thousand men cannot feel fury as if with one heart, unless I use circumstances to anger them.몯
A classic historical example of this is when the state of Yan attacked the state of Qi, besieging the Qi city of Jimo, which was under the command of Qi general Tian Dan. During the siege, the Yan army had captured some Qi prisoners, and it was decided that all of the captives몭 noses should be cut off. This infuriated the people of Qi, and only stiffened their resolve to defend their city. Tian Dan saw an opportunity. He wanted to fan the flames of his people몭s rage, and turn their grief into a power strong enough to crush the Yan army.
Tian Dan sent an agent into the Yan camp, where he spread a rumor that what the people of Qi dreaded above anything else was that the Yan soldiers might dig up their ancestral graves, which were outside of the city walls. According to the rumor, the people of Qi would feel so humiliated by the desecration of their ancestors that they would completely collapse. If this happened, they몭d be sure to surrender and beg the Yan army to relent. 
The Yan army fell for it. They not only dug up the Qi ancestral graves, but even burned the bodies. The people of Qi saw everything from where they stood on the ramparts. Now, the flames of fury were truly blazing in their eyes and Tian Dan could see that his men were ready to be used. He led his men out of the city to fight, and the men of Qi went berserk with killing. The Yan army was crushed.
Now, let몭s look at 몬bounty.몭
Cao Cao comments: 몮If there몭s no money to be made in the army, don몭t expect new recruits; if an army gives no rewards, don몭t expect your men to go where you command.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮Wealth and goods can be used to lure soldiers, to make them willing to defeat the enemy. The wealth and goods obtained by defeating the enemy must be distributed as rewards; ensure that everyone desires these things, and each one of your men will fight. When men know that defeating the enemy will bring them rich reward, this is all the enticement needed to make them joyfully advance through an onslaught of arrows, stones and bared blades.몯
It몭s quite common in military discussions to talk about this or that army having 몬good discipline몭 or 몬bad discipline.몭 The truth is that the only factor that decides whether an army몭s discipline is good or bad is the commander몭s strategic objective. If an army has good discipline, and refrains from bullying local civilians, it몭s because the commander has a political objective. If an army has poor discipline and marauds through civilian settlements, burning, raping and pillaging, it몭s because this is being intentionally used as an incentive mechanism. In many prolonged sieges, when the people of the city stubbornly refuse to surrender, it became no longer necessary for the besieging army to treat the enemy civilian population well. In these cases, the besieging army몭s commander would often incentivize his men to stick out a long siege by telling them that after the city fell, they몭d be allowed to ransack and pillage the place for three days, or even seven days, and that they could keep for themselves anything that they took from the city, including girls and women.
This kind of incentive was enough to drive soldiers into a frenzy.
When Zeng Guofan몭s Hunan army took the city of Nanjing from the Taiping rebels, his army didn몭t exercise a shred of discipline. They burned, murdered, robbed and raped, and once they몭d plundered every last item of value, they destroyed the evidence by burning down the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom몭s palace. Later, the Hunan army commanders reported to the Qing Empress Dowager that Nanjing 몬contained nothing of any value.몭
몮As it turns out,몯 they claimed, 몮that Taiping fellow8 really was a model of purity and thrift!몯
But Zeng Guofan was one of the great Confucianists of his age 멪 how could an army under his command have behaved like this? Clearly, he had made a promise to his men. He would have told them something like, 몮The imperial court hasn몭t any money to give us, and yet we Hunanese have willingly come to fight for the court. Well, when we win, we know that the cities and the land that we conquer will go to the Empress Dowager. Since that is the case, my brothers, the money and other valuables will be ours.몯 This was basically an unwritten rule.
And what did the Empress Dowager Cixi make of this? As far as she was concerned, if they said there was no money in Nanjing, there was no money in Nanjing. She never asked any questions about the missing money and valuables, but instead chose to look the other way, even though she knew very well that the riches of Nanjing had been taken back to Hunan.
Sometimes, the Emperor himself will publicly announce as a policy that his men are expected to act in this way. For example, when Emperor Taizu of the Song dynasty was about to attack Shu (modern-day Sichuan Province), he issued this order: 몮All provinces and counties that my army conquers are to be my property, while all granaries, warehouses, and the goods stored within are to be divided in their entirety among the soldiers as their reward.몯 Apparently, all that the state desires is land, land and more land.
Famous generals of all eras have one thing in common: a willingness to share money among all their men. The classic way of doing this was to give any and all valuables or money seized from the enemy or from civilians directly to the soldiers. The commander would not keep a single penny for himself, and instead would only accept rewards given by the Emperor. Because the general didn몭t take a share of the bounty, any of his men who were unsatisfied with their own share had no grounds to complain or even mention the word 몬unfair.몭 When generals do this, their men are willing to fight alongside them, so they win more battles and rise more quickly up through the ranks.



Watch who is the first to climb the city walls

Extract from the original text:
몮Therefore, in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept. This is called using the conquered foe to augment one몭s own strength. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns. Thus, it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people몭s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.몯

Analysis:
몮In chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first.몯 But why?  You have to think about the numbers of people involved when you capture ten chariots. We know that each chariot comes with a unit of 75 men. Chariots were deployed in units of five, known as a dui, and also in units of ten, known as a guan. Each dui would be led by five officers (pushe) and each guan also came with ten additional officers (zuzhang). So, ten chariots come with a total of 770 men. To capture this many men, you몭d need at least 1,000 of your own men to do the job. Yet, if you tried to give rewards to every one of these thousand men, the incentive mechanism would break, and anyway the state treasury couldn몭t even afford such generosity.
That몭s one of the reasons why only the first man to capture a chariot is to be rewarded. It몭s also because he is usually the one at the head of the charge; when his comrades see him running ahead, they charge after him, becoming a single mass of charging soldiers.
It몭s the same in a siege. The first man to set foot on the enemy몭s walls has to be richly rewarded, because this is the only way to ensure all of your men will be able to summon the courage to throw themselves ahead of the pack and into the thick of the fighting. For the commander standing at the back and directing the battle from afar, it몭s just as important to clearly see who the first man on the walls is as it is to command the course of the battle, because if you can몭t quite make out which man needs to be rewarded, when the next battle comes none of your men will have much interest in being at the front of the line. When that happens, you can hand out whatever commands you like, but nothing will work.
Fighting battles is in itself all about two armies trying to snatch each other몭s weapons and other resources 멪 basically, trying to profit from the enemy. In the Chinese TV drama, Drawing Sword, the character Li Yunlong has a quirky habit: every time he wins a battle, he joyfully announces: 몮I몭m rich!몯 That explains it pretty well. 
On the ancient Chinese battlefield, it went without saying that your charioteers would try to pilfer the enemy몭s chariots, your cavalry would try to pilfer the enemy몭s cavalry, and your infantry would try to pilfer the enemy몭s infantry. When General Wu Qi did battle against a Qin army, he told his three armies: 몮Though we may destroy the enemy, any victory we might gain would be meritless unless our chariots take from their chariots, our cavalry take from their cavalry, and our infantry take from their infantry!몯 This is one of the criteria for success in war; it몭s not enough just to kill the enemy and win the day. Your charioteers absolutely must come back in possession of the enemy몭s chariots, your cavalry need to wrangle the enemy몭s horses and equipment, and it몭s imperative that your infantrymen take the enemy몭s weapons. Only if your men successfully do this should you tell them they몭ve done a good job, and hand out rewards.
When you capture an enemy chariot, you should immediately take down the battle flag from its banner pole and put your own flag up there. Then, squeeze the chariot into one of your own chariot units and send it out to fight for you. 
What about when you take enemy soldiers prisoner? Sun Tzu said, 몮Captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.몯 Explain clearly to them what your policies are, and try to win them over so they몭ll join your army and be of service to you.
Sun Tzu몭s thinking on this point was remarkable for the times he lived in. In ancient Chinese wars, killing enemy soldiers who몭d surrendered was a widespread practice. This was because when you suddenly find yourself in charge of several hundred thousand prisoners of war, it몭s very difficult to control so many men, let alone feed and water them. You don몭t dare trust them, so generals often solved the problem by digging a huge pit and filling it with bodies. A classic example of this is Lord Changping of Qin, who buried alive 400,000 soldiers from the state of Zhao, en masse. Xiang Yu took it even further, leaving mass graves behind him everywhere he went. He is known to have buried alive 200,000 Qin soldiers at once, cementing the hatred showered upon him by the people of Qin.
The most classic example of the opposite approach 멪 treating captive soldiers well and putting them to use 멪 comes to us courtesy of Emperor Guangwu of the Han dynasty (Han Guangwu). When Han Guangwu defeated the rebel Tong Mazei at Nanyang, he captured over 100,000 men, all of whom he integrated into his own army. But, the captured men still felt uneasy, because their original commander, Tong Mazei, had already surrendered once before, to rebel a second time, and he ultimately surrendered again. The rebel commanders were sure that Emperor Guangwu wouldn몭t dare trust them.
Emperor Guangwu was well aware what the captured men were thinking, so he told them to return to their various camps and that he would come and visit them there. True to his word, he visited each of the rebel camps with an entourage of only a dozen or so cavalrymen. This was his way of showing the rebels that he trusted them enough to put his own life at their mercy. The rebel commanders were moved to tears by Guangwu몭s gesture, and said: 몮My king, you put your beating heart between the teeth of others. Your sincerity is astounding!몯 There is a Chinese idiom still in use today that comes from this story, meaning 몬To trust somebody completely.몭 Guangwu instantly became much more powerful now that he had the rebel forces under his command. This is what it means to grow stronger in victory.
If you kill 1,000 of the enemy몭s men, but lose 800 of your own, that is not a victory 멪 both sides lose. The only difference is that the enemy몭s loss is heavier. This is why Sun Tzu promotes the idea of 몬having it all.몭 The first priority is keeping your own forces whole, and then winning a complete victory, ideally while keeping the enemy forces intact. Sun Tzu몭s entire system of military thinking is: not fighting; fighting cautiously; and fighting swiftly.

몮War is not a plaything.몯  

Right at the outset of Sun Tzu몭 s The Art of War, he declares that war is a matter of survival for both state and people. War is incomparably dangerous, and it must be carried out cautiously. First, make careful calculations in the temple 멪 this is the 몬The Five Factors and Seven Considerations.몭 If you don몭t have good odds of victory, check yourself. Don몭t start a war that you might not win. If the odds are with you, go to war with the aim of settling it in a single battle.

몮In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.몯

Cao Cao comments on this line: 몮Long campaigns are not beneficial, for war is like fire; without restraint, one may easily set fire to oneself.몯 Cao Cao literally proved his own point when his fleet was set ablaze by Liu Bei몭s unmanned 몬fire ships몭 at the Battle of Red Cliffs.

몮Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people몭s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.몯

In the original Chinese text, 몬arbiter몭 is actually a constellation of stars, one that몭s supposed to be in charge of people몭s births, deaths and lifespans. That몭s the power and responsibility a general has over the lives of the people. The star who watched over the people of Zhao during the first part of the Battle of Changping was General Lian Po, and because of him the people of Zhao stayed alive. But when Lian Po몭s star was lowered from the sky and replaced with Zhao Kuo, the result was death for 400,000 men and a country left hanging over the edge of the abyss. Likewise, in the 20th century, it was the generals who must be blamed for the countless young lives cut short in the meat grinder that was the First World War.
In our daily lives, we all face 몬the road either to safety or to ruin.몭 For example, it몭s often said that from journalists몭 pens flow great riches, that they wield power over human lives and have the ability to make or destroy reputations, and even to determine right and wrong, and truth itself. Whatever tool you hold in your hands, whether a gun, a pen or the steering wheel of a car, your next move affects the lives and financial wellbeing of other people. Sun Tzu knew this, and that몭s why he has taught us responsibility and reverent wariness.
       
       


       
Appendix: Complete text of Waging War

Sun Tzu said: 몮In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand sets of armor, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand gold pieces per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men몭s weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be dampened. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.
몮There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the dangers of war that can thoroughly understand the beneficial way of carrying it on. Those skilled in war do not raise a second levy, and their supply-wagons are not loaded three times. Bring war material with you from home, but procure your food from the enemy. Thus, the army will have provisions enough for its needs.  A State, and its common people, can be impoverished by a commander who transports supplies over great distances. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up, and high prices cause the people몭s substance to be drained away. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and seven-tenths of their income will be dissipated. Meanwhile, government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to six-tenths of its total revenue. Hence, a wise general makes a point of obtaining food from the enemy. One zhong of the enemy몭s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one몭s own, and likewise, a single picul of his fodder is equivalent to twenty from one몭s own store. 
몮Now, in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards. Therefore, in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept. This is called using the conquered foe to augment one몭s own strength. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns. Thus, it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people몭s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.몯


Chapter Three
Planning Assaults

The best way to plan an attack is not attacking; Win without attacking

Extract from the original text:
몮In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy몭s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is second best. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entirely than to destroy it; to capture a battalion, a company or a squad entirely than to destroy them. Hence, to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy몭s resistance without fighting.몯

Analysis:
The first chapter of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War is about calculations, the second is about fighting pitched battles in the field, and the third takes us into the topic of attacking cities. There is an order to this, and a clue as to why this chapter follows the one about pitched battles comes in the form of a comment written by Li Quan: 몮When two armies meet, this is known as 몬battle.몭 When a city is surrounded, this is known as an 몬assault.몭몯 This brief comment shows why this chapter comes after the one about 몬battles.몭
Cao Cao simply comments: 몮If you want to carry out an assault against your enemy, you must first plan.몯
What needs to be planned? A comment by Wang Xi explains: 몮Plan the benefits and dangers of assaulting the enemy, develop a comprehensive plan to defeat them, and do not be hasty to send out your troops or assault the city.몯
Once again, it comes back to the benefit-danger dynamic 멪 avoiding danger and following benefit. You don몭t fight wars just to kill your enemies, because when you kill your enemies, there is always a price to be paid; perhaps you kill 100,000 of your enemies, but lose 800 of your own in the process. The best outcome is to defeat the enemy army without a battle. Make sure the enemy knows the balance of dangers and benefits. Make the enemy surrender, and the whole city, with all of its people, goods and money, will be yours to keep. This is the basic idea behind Sun Tzu몭s philosophy of 몬having it all.몭


몮The best thing of all is to take the enemy몭s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it second best.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Mobilize your generals, drive your army deep into enemy territory, keep your distance from their city walls, cut off connections between their city and the hinterland, and cause the enemy to surrender his country to you; this is the best way. Destroying the city with your soldiers and gaining it only after defeating the enemy is not as good.몯
Surround the enemy, fill him with despair, and make sure he clearly sees the situation he is in, and then he will surrender. This is the absolute best way to win, the pinnacle. But, if he does decide to make like a cornered animal and fight to the bitter end, you will have to assault his city and defeat him in battle. There will be a price to pay, and what you몭ll get at the end won몭t be an intact city, but one that lies in ruins. Not to mention that anything can happen on the battlefield; there몭s no such thing as a guaranteed victory.
Before Cao Cao몭s unfortunate run-in with the fire ships, he had successfully marched his armies south of the Yangzi River, where he accepted the surrender of General Liu Cong, and even got his hands on naval forces formerly under the command of Cai Mao and Zhang Yun. This is a good example of Sun Tzu몭s dictum: 몮The best thing of all is to take the enemy몭s country whole.몯 But, Cao Cao몭s winning streak came to an end when Sun Quan, Emperor of Eastern Wu, refused to surrender. The Battle of Red Cliffs happened not long after, dealing Cao Cao a catastrophic defeat. His forces never again set foot in Eastern Wu.
During the wars between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, Liu Bang once entrusted a mission to his advisor Li Yiji: to go to the state of Qi and convince its king, Tian Guang, to surrender. The mission was a success, and another example of Sun Tzu몭s dictum. Li Yiji stayed in the Qi capital as a voluntary hostage, and told the king that if Liu Bei몭s Han armies ever invaded Qi, the king could throw him in the soup pot and boil him alive. Every day, the king and Li Yiji drank and ate together, and eventually the king did as Li Yiji said, dissolving the Qi garrison.
Unfortunately, one of Liu Bei몭s generals, Han Xin, felt a little bothered by Li Yiji몭s success, using his powers of persuasion to talk the mighty state of Qi into surrendering. Han Xin몭s thinking was probably something along the lines of: 몬Why should a bookish weakling like Li Yiji get more credit than me?몭 So, Han Xin secretly plotted to make a move of his own 멪 a sudden attack on the Qi army, which was stationed in Lixia. The state of Qi was caught with its defenses down, and Han Xin몭s army rolled over it like a wave. The Qi king was sure that he had been betrayed by Li Yiji, and sure enough, threw the man in a soup pot and boiled him alive. As for the king, he got caught up in the fighting and was killed. 
One might wonder if Han Xin didn몭t grasp the concept that 몬The best thing of all is to take the enemy몭s country whole.몭 Of course he understood the concept. He had put it into practice himself against the kingdom of Yan. He cowed the Yan king into submission with the fearsome reputation he had made for himself by capturing Xia Shuo and King Bao of Wei, and by executing the Lord of Cheng몭an. All it took for Yan to surrender was one messenger and a single letter. 
Just like Yan, Qi had surrendered. But the difference was that it wasn몭t he, Han Xin, who had made them surrender, but one of his colleagues. So, Han Xin decided to go for the next-best thing: 몬A broken country.몭 He destroyed Qi and killed its soldiers and war horses, even though they were already Liu Bang몭s property. When he몭d finished, he went straight back to Liu Bang and tried to twist his arm into granting him the title of 몬King of Qi.몭 In reality, Han Xin was sowing the seeds of not just his own downfall, but the destruction of his entire family line.
The Ming dynasty writer Wang Fuzhi said there was nothing unjust about Han Xin몭s death, because in his heart he was not truly loyal to Liu Bang. For Han Xin, his relationship with Liu Bang was about trying to extract as much as possible from his lord; it was about benefitting himself. Wang Fuzhi put it like this: 몮He poisoned the whole world, and then succumbed to his own poison; he was nothing more than a man greedy for credit! Sir Li persuaded Qi to surrender, and Qi was prepared to accept this counsel. With this achieved, there was no longer cause for worry in the Northeast, and Xiang Yu몭s right-hand line of support was severed. Consider Jing Bu 멪 he was a criminal, and yet having once turned away from Xiang Yu and come to Liu Bei몭s side, it was out of the question that he would ever rebel against Liu Bei. How much more could the Qi king Tian Guang be trusted? He is an upright man, and there is no doubt that he would not have been the cause of any concern for Liu Bei. Yet, Han Xin hankered after success, and so followed after the example of Kuai Che, frenziedly attacking Qi, though Qi had already relented. As a result, Sir Li was hurled into a boiling vessel, and the Qi army was slaughtered at Li Xia, so that rivulets of blood flowed o몭er the open country. King Tian Guang and his entire family were exterminated. The tragedy of it! The stirrings of greed originated in ethereal darkness, and ended with soldiers몭 shields floating away on currents of blood.몯  
Wang Fuzhi explained why there was nothing unjust about Han Xin몭s death, and pointed out that if anyone died unjustly, it was King Tiang Guang and Li Yiji.	 몮It is better to recapture an army entirely than to destroy it, to capture a battalion, a company or a squad entirely than to destroy them.몯
This line delves into the organizational divisions within an army. Here, an 몬army몭 refers to 12,500 men; a battalion is 500 men; a company is 100 men; and a squad, the smallest unit, is five men. The basic message is that no matter what scale or level you몭re working at, from a whole country down to a single squad, you should always strive to keep everything whole and intact, and remember that winning without fighting is the perfect way to do this.
This is why there몭s nothing particularly great about fighting and winning a hundred battles. In the words of the Warring States period polymath, Li Kui, when he was advising Marquess Wen of Wei: 몮With many victories comes certain ruin.몯 This is because in every battle fought, something is used up and depleted; there is always a price to be paid. After a hundred battles, the people are exhausted; after a hundred victories, the ruler becomes arrogant. When the people are exhausted and the ruler is arrogant, the enemy is likely to find a long-repressed reserve of strength, and when the next battle comes, suddenly the tables will turn. And that몭s not to mention that if you몭re still fighting after a hundred victories, clearly the 몬victories몭 you몭ve been winning aren몭t exactly of the highest quality, because you still haven몭t solved your problem.
This is why causing your enemy to submit without fighting him is 몬supreme excellence.몭 It몭s possible to finish your business just by writing a letter; the pen has the power to bring peace to the realm. If that doesn몭t work out, the next best thing is to solve your problems in a single battle. When you find yourself having won a hundred battles, that in itself is a problem.
The supreme strategy is to attack and sabotage the enemy몭s plans

Extract from the original text:
몮Thus, the highest form of generalship is to attack the enemy몭s plans; the next best is to attack the enemy몭s alliances; the next in order is to attack the enemy몭s army in the field.몯

Analysis:
몮The highest form of generalship is to attack the enemy몭s plans.몯 You don몭t have to use stratagems to fight a war. What Sun Tzu is telling us here is that you should disrupt the enemy몭s stratagems. In war, both sides finalize their stratagems before making their first move, so if you can destroy your enemy몭s stratagem, they won몭t be going anywhere.
The all-time classic historical example would be when Kou Xun attacked Gao Jun during the Eastern Han dynasty (23-221 CE). Gao Jun sent an agent, Huang Puwen, to visit Kou Xun. Without the slightest hesitation, Kou Xun had the agent killed. Then, he sent a letter back to Gao Jun, saying: 몮Your general was very rude, so I took his head. If you몭re going to surrender, be quick about it. If not, you몭d better dig in tight!몯 The same day that Gao Jun received the letter, he opened his gates and surrendered.
The generals didn몭t understand, and asked Kou Xun: 몮These are two states that have always settled things in battle, not by decapitating emissaries. Why did he fall over backward to surrender to you just because you executed his envoy? You weren몭t even at war at that point!몯
Kou Xun explained: That 몬envoy,몭 Huang Puwen, was Gao Jun몭s chief general, the man he relied on more than anyone. The reason Gao Jun sent him to me was to see what my strengths and weaknesses are, so that he could go back with the information and get down to planning. If I몭d spared him, he would have given Gao Jun a stratagem, but as it happened, I killed him, and Gao Jun lost his nerve.몯
Killing Huang Puwen ensured that Gao Jun was left with no ideas, and no guts, either. This is exactly what it means to say 몬The highest form of generalship is to attack the enemy몭s plans.몭
Kou Xun몭s story is an extreme case, in which he took the most direct route possible: killing the enemy몭s planner-in-chief. Under normal circumstances, this kind of opportunity doesn몭t just present itself. Instead, you have to focus on analysis and clarity of judgment as a way to sabotage the enemy몭s plans.
This chapter몭s second example is about the origins of a Chinese idiom that basically means, 몬To win by diplomacy.몭 The literal translation is 몬Block the enemy몭s charge with vessels of wine.몭 The wording of 몬block the charge몭 comes from the name of a type of ancient Chinese war chariot, the zhechongqi, which was designed to sever an enemy charge in a similar way to snapping a knife blade. The basic idea is to pluck victory from negotiations at the banquet table, rather than resorting to violence. The idiom is based on the story of Yan Ying, a famous statesman from Qi who lived during the Spring and Autumn period.
Duke Ping of Jin had designs on attacking Qi, so he sent Fan Zhao as an envoy to gather information. When Fan Zhao arrived, Duke Jing of Qi held a banquet to welcome him. The wine was half drunk, and Fan Zhao suddenly said to Duke Jing: 몮Would it be permissible for me to request a drink of wine from your cup?몯 Duke Jing replied: 몮I see no reason why not, since you are my guest! Come, a servant will pour my wine into your cup!몯
Fan Zhao downed Duke Jing몭s wine in one gulp, and just as a servant was about to pour more wine for both of them, Yan Yin shouted: 몮Wait a moment! Bring a new cup for our lord!몯
Fan Zhao was none too pleased by this. He got up and, pretending to be drunk, began dancing and shouted over to the Grand Preceptor,  a high-ranking official: 몮I want to have a dance! Can you play some music from Chengzhou?몯 The Grand Preceptor몭s reply was icy: 몮Nobody present is capable of playing the music you speak of.몯 This seemed to irk Fan Zhao, and he soon took his leave.
As the banquet drew to a close, Duke Jing said to his advisers: 몮What got in to you today? That man is the envoy of a powerful state, who came here to observe our ways of governance, and you몭ve all annoyed him. What good does that do us? Won몭t this just bring us more trouble?몯
Yan Ying replied: 몮He came to observe our ways of governance, and that몭s exactly what we showed him. You see, my lord, it몭s not that this Zhao Fan fellow doesn몭t understand proper etiquette; he was intentionally behaving in a belligerent manner. There is a clear difference of rank between rulers and ministers 멪 demanding the wine from a duke몭s goblet is a provocation. He was testing us. That몭s why I had your cup changed, my lord, so as not to throw the proper hierarchy into disorder by drinking from the same vessel as him.몯
The Grand Preceptor had his own piece to say: 몮The music of Chengzhou is sacred music. It belongs to the Son of Heaven (the Zhou king), and it is not for ministers or anyone else to dance along to. So, of course I couldn몭t play it for him.몯
Fan Zhao returned to Jin, and made his report to Duke Ping: 몮Do not invade Qi. I tried to humiliate their duke, but Yan Ying saw through me. Then, I tried to dishonor their ceremonial rites, but this time the Grand Preceptor called me out. Qi is a state with capable, virtuous ministers!몯
Confucius himself once praised the ministers of Qi, exclaiming: 몮Without taking the matter beyond wine vessels, Yan Ying blocked his enemy몭s attack from a thousand li distant.몯 
This is a man who, amid raised glasses and courteous smiles, destroyed the Jin plan to assault Qi, and beat the enemy back 1,000 li. This is the epitome of 몬attacking the enemy몭s plans.몭
Our third example comes from the Qin invasion of Jin, also during the Spring and Autumn period. The man in charge of the Jin army sent to stop the Qin was named Zhao Dun, but the Jin prime minister and overall military leader, Yu Pian, had his own idea: 몮The Qin army has travelled a long way, so they won몭t be able to stay long. We should build our walls higher and dig our moats deeper. All we need to do is wait around for the Qin soldiers to give up and go home.몯
The plan was put into action, and the Qin army was stuck. There was no fighting to be had, but they  couldn몭t retreat with nothing to show for it. Duke Mu of Qin asked his adviser Shi Hui what could be done. Shi Hui said: 몮I몭m absolutely positive that this is Yu Pian몭s idea. But there몭s another general in the Jin army, a young man named Zhao Chuan. He몭s Zhao Dun몭s nephew, and also the son-in-law of the Jin duke. He has no understanding whatsoever of military affairs, he몭s been spoiled to the point of arrogance, and he has a romantic love of bravery that renders him reckless. Importantly, he is not at all keen on Yu Pian being given the position of prime minister. If we can provoke Zhao Chuan몭s men, he몭s sure to come out and fight.몯
The Qin army did just that 멪 they harassed Zhao Chuan. Sure enough, Zhao Chuan led his men out in pursuit of his tormenters, but he couldn몭t catch them. Furious, he went back and fumed: 몮What are we doing here? Here we are, wearing armor and with food provisions ready, precisely so that we can kill our enemies. And yet we몭re not fighting! Why?몯 One of his men told him that they were waiting for the right opportunity, but Zhao Chuan didn몭t listen. 몮I don몭t care if they have some clever stratagem. If the others won몭t fight, I몭ll fight on my own!몯 he retorted, and promptly led his men out to fight. When Zhao Dun heard what his nephew had done, he was frustrated, but he didn몭t have a choice. He had to save Zhao Chuan, so he led out the entire Jin army and fought a terrible, daylong battle with the Qin army. At the end, it was unclear who had won and who had lost.
Each of the above three cases is different 멪 Kou Xun killed his enemy몭s planner-in-chief, Yan Ying nipped his enemy몭s plan in the bud, and Shi Hui sabotaged his enemy몭s plan when it was already in motion. But, each of them is a classic example of 몬attacking the enemy몭s plans.몭



Don몭t act like a dunce just because your teammate is a dunce

Extract from the original text:
몮Thus, the highest form of generalship is to attack the enemy몭s plans; the next best is to attack the enemy몭s alliances; the next in order is to attack the enemy몭s army in the field.몯

Analysis:
In the previous chapter, we established that 몬attacking the enemy몭s plans몭 is about attacking the enemy몭s thoughts and rooting out their ideas. This forces them to realize: a) They몭re unprepared; b) Their odds are lousy; c) Attacking you would be very risky; and d) They should give up on their plan.
In this chapter, we move on to look at 몬attacking the enemy몭s alliances.몭 This is the practice of diplomacy (and counter-diplomacy) as a part of war. 
Historians of ancient China often talk about the 몬Vertical and Horizontal Alliances of the Roaming Diplomats,몭 during the Warring States period. There were two main ideas: that the various states lying on the east-west (horizontal) axis should form an alliance on the one hand, and on the other hand, that a north-south array of states should join together. The most famous diplomats behind them were, respectively, Zhang Yi and Su Qin. Su Qin몭s 몬vertical alliance몭 idea aimed to unite six states to jointly resist Qin, which had become a formidable power. The 몬horizontal alliance몭 idea came later, and Zhang Yi toured each of the six states in the vertical alliance, lobbying their rulers to ally with Qin. He pushed the line that cosying up to Qin would at least give them some respite from the constant fighting. Zhang몭s real aim was to dismantle the vertical alliance and isolate the six states. Then, Qin would destroy them, one by one. This historical era still echoes in the Chinese language today 멪 몬vertical-horizontal몭 is a commonly used Chinese word with a range of applications. It often means 몬interconnected.몭
A classic story from this period, and one that nicely demonstrates Sun Tzu몭s principles, is the tale of how Zhang Yi attacked the alliance between the state of Qi and King Huai of Chu.
First, Zhang Yi visited Chu, where he tried to tempt King Huai by offering him 600 li of land in Shangyu if he cut off his alliance with Qi and formed a new one with Qin. King Huai was delighted by this offer, and wasted no time accepting. He cut his ties with Qi, and sent a general to Qin to take possession of the land that had been promised him. But, Zhang Yi would not grant an audience to the visiting Chu general, claiming he was ill. King Huai began to ask himself questions. 몮Zhang Yi probably doesn몭t believe that I몭ve already called off my alliance with Qi,몯 he thought. So, he devised a way of showing his loyalty to Qin: he sent a warrior to Qi with instructions to insult and humiliate the Qi king. The Qi king was stunned by this sudden reversal, and stung by the humiliation, and flew into a rage. He retaliated by announcing that he was personally ending his alliance with Chu, and not only that, he also immediately allied himself with Qin.
Zhang Yi picked this moment to finally talk with the visiting Chu general, and fulfill his promise. That is, he partially fulfilled it. Of the 600 li of land he originally offered, he handed over only 6. Two zeros had gone missing
King Huai of Chu was outraged when he heard this, and immediately launched an attack on Qin. But, without the helping hand of their former ally, Qi, Chu was much too weak to beat Qin. Chu몭s defeat was catastrophic, and marked the beginning of the end 멪 Chu quickly fell into terminal decline.
The lessons to be learned from this story don몭t just come at the expense of King Huai of Chu, but also from the reaction of Qi. When Qin attacked Chu몭s alliance with Qi, shouldn몭t it have been  obvious that this also represented an attack against Qi; an attack on its own alliance with Chu? If your teammate acts like a fool, that doesn몭t mean that you should also act like a fool. When Chu attacked Qin, Qi could have come to their former ally몭s aid. Then, the Chu ruler would have felt both ashamed and grateful, and as a result the Chu-Qi alliance would be stronger than ever. Meanwhile, the real enemy, Qin, would have been thwarted, their plan a bust. As it happened, King Huai was not the only fool in this story; the King of Qi was just as foolish.
In the last chapter, we saw an example of a brutally direct way of 몬attacking the enemy몭s plans몭 멪 killing their chief planner. Similar to 몬attacking the enemy몭s alliances,몭 there are a surprising number of cases where a state has defeated the enemy by killing their diplomats.
During the wars between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, both had sent envoys to try to persuade the rebel leader Ying Bu, who was sitting on the fence, to join their side. Ying Bu seemed to be leaning toward joining Liu Bei, but he was hesitant to commit. Meanwhile, he was still meeting and chatting with Xiang Yu몭s messenger, in the inn where Xiang Yu몭s man was staying. During one of these conversations, Xiang Yu몭s messenger chose his moment, and began pressing Ying Bu to send troops to help Xiang Yu.
Liu Bei몭s messenger, Sui He, knew what was happening, and made a quick decision. He burst into the room where the two men were talking, sat down in his counterpart몭s seat, and shouted: 몮The King of Huainan has already declared for Liu Bei. What are you talking about 멪 몬send troops?몭몯 Xiang Yu몭s envoy was startled, and made to leave the inn. Ying Bu seemed frozen to his seat. 몮We can몭t let him go. Kill him!몯 Sui He shouted. Ying Bu found himself forced into a corner. He had to make a decision now, even if he didn몭t want to. In fact, he did as Sui He said. He killed Xiang Yu몭s envoy, and led his soldiers to Liu Bei몭s in Han.
There몭s another famous example of destroying an alliance by killing a diplomat: the story of an Eastern Han dynasty general and diplomat named Ban Chao. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to the state of Shanshan in the western territories of the empire (a Central Asian region southwest of the Lopnor salt lake in modern-day Xinjiang autonomous region). At first, Ban Chao and his fellow travelers were warmly welcomed by the King of Shanshan. Yet, within a few days the mood turned cold. Ban Chao made enquiries high and low, and learned that the Northern Xiongnu had also sent an envoy to Shanshan. It seems that the King was trying to make his mind up about whom to ally himself with.
Ban Chao was nothing if not bold. He gathered 36 of his men and in the middle of the night launched a surprise attack on the inn where the Xiongnu envoy was staying, killing every member of their diplomatic team. Then, he took the envoy몭s head and went to see the King of Shanshan. The King was scared witless 멪 how could he explain to the Xiongnu why their envoy had died in his country? He couldn몭t, so his only option was to submit to the Han Emperor. He sent Ban Chao back to the capital, Chang몭an, with his own son, the prince, as a hostage to guarantee the new relationship between Shanshan and Chang몭an.

몮The next best thing is to attack the enemy몭s army in the field.몯 

This last option is saved for when you몭ve tried the first two, but they haven몭t worked. The first Zhou King몭s advisor, Jiang Ziya, said: 몮A leader who seeks victory by the blade of his sword, does not a good general make.몯
	



You don몭t win just by beating the enemy. The real test is: have you grown stronger, or weaker?

Extract from the original text:
몮Besieging walled cities is an option chosen only when nothing else is successful. The preparation of mantlets, armored wagons, and various implements of war will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain while the city still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.몯

Analysis:
몬Mantlets몭 are a kind of large shield, which can cover a soldier몭s entire body, while 몬armored wagons몭 were leather-covered, four-wheeled troop-carriers, especially designed for sieges. Basically, they were the ancient Chinese equivalent of an armored personnel carrier. One wagon could carry several dozen men directly to the base of the enemy몭s city wall. Other siege equipment 멪 like siege towers and ladders, shelters made of wooden planks and catapults 멪 would take at least three months to build and prepare for battle. 
It would also take three months to finish various siege-related engineering projects, like shifting earth to make tuyin, a kind of mound used to give your soldiers access to the top of the enemy몭s walls, digging tunnels, and dealing with moats either by building bridges or filling them with earth.
Besieging a city is a slow grind, but it also requires attention to detail. If the besieging army몭s general is impatient, he might opt for the 몬swarming ants몭 tactic and end up losing a third of his men while still not capturing the city 멪 a disastrous scenario. It몭s not hard to imagine what a tactic named 몬swarming ants몭 entails. Basically, you cluster your soldiers into a dense mass and swarm up the city walls like ants. Of course, they몭ll be greeted on the way with arrows, rocks, boiling water, sizzling oil and fire. 몬swarming ants몭 is also known as 몬fluttering moth.몭 Perhaps this captures the image better.
This is why assaulting a city is a pretty desperate option, reserved only for when your original backup plan몭s backup plan has already fallen through. 
Sun Tzu몭s philosophy has a consistent thread: put aside all thoughts of winning and not winning, and instead concern yourself with making sure you don몭t lose. What really matters is whether you몭ve grown stronger or weaker. Don몭t put yourself in a position where your losses outweigh your gains, and don몭t throw away human lives. Life has value.
A classic example is the non-Chinese Tuoba Emperor Taiwu, of Northern Wei몭s attack on the Liu Song dynasty in Xuyi. Perhaps our ethnic minority cousins are naturally less constrained, but he was certainly playing loose when, on his way to attack a Liu Song city, he sent an envoy ahead to demand wine from the Liu Song garrison commander, Cang Zhi. The commander apparently wasn몭t in the mood to be accommodating. He produced several jars, and ordered his men to urinate in them. He gave them to the Tuoba envoy and sent him back. The Tuoba Emperor was furious, and immediately gave the order to storm the city. He commanded his men to scale the walls in waves, and warned that anyone who retreated would be executed. This went on for a month, and in the end, Tuoba bodies were piled as high as the city walls. Over half of Emperor Taiwu몭s men lay dead, he몭d killed his own vanguard leader, Gao Liangwang, and he still hadn몭t captured the city.  Finally, seeing his camp full of wounded and diseased soldiers, and fearing that his escape route might be cut off, he lifted the siege and beat a retreat, taking his grudge with him.
There was a general during the Republic of China period (1912-1949 CE) named Fu Zuoyi, who became famous for peacefully liberating the city of Beijing. But the moment that defined him was the battle of Zhuozhou, and the way he really made his name was as a formidable defender. No one was better than him at holding a city during a siege. 
During the war between the Zhili and Fengtian warlord cliques, although Fu Zuoyi몭s enemies, the Fengtian clique, had just won, he led a small, isolated force, determined to hold Zhuozhou against the enemy. He had no food, and he was cut off from all outside support, yet he refused to surrender. He was besieged by a Fengtian army of 50,000 men, while he had only several thousand. The siege went on for two months, with indiscriminate firebombing. The Fengtian commander, Zhang Xueliang, was hell-bent on leveling the city, and yet Fu Zuoyi kept on fighting. Eventually, the Fengtian commander-in-chief, Zhang Zuolin, let his anger at being denied victory make his decisions for him 멪 never a good idea! But Zhang didn몭t try the 몬swarming ants몭 tactic. Instead, he wanted to put Fu Zuoyi in his place by using some high-tech weaponry: poison gas canisters, 500 of them, hurled into the city.
After the noxious haze cleared, the Fengtian attacked one more time, but Fu Zuoyi was still there, and managed to push the Fengtian forces back again!
Zhang Zuolin gave up. 몮This kid몭s not going to surrender,몯 he told Zhang Xueliang. 몮No more trying to fight him. We몭ll starve him instead! Keep the city surrounded!몯
At that point, the Zhili clique leader, Yan Xishan, decided there wasn몭t much need to keep on fighting, so he instructed Fu Zuoyi to sue for peace. Only then did Fu Zuoyi finally sign a treaty and accept the Fengtian forces몭 terms.
A couple of decades later, when Communist Party General Lin Biao was besieging the city of Changchun, he used the same tactic that Zhang Zuolin eventually settled for: he surrounded the city and waited. Eventually, the Nationalist army starved, and it ultimately surrendered.



Adopt failure as the premise of your thinking; This is the foundation of military wisdom

Extract from the original text:
몮Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy몭s troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.몯

Analysis:
This is Sun Tzu몭s summary of 몬Planning Assaults.몭 He shows that, at its root, it is about planning to maintain 몬wholeness.몭 This not only ensures that you don몭t suffer any losses, but you also avoid damaging the enemy몭s assets, and fully benefit from taking them for yourself. To achieve this, you have to follow the three no몭s: no fighting, no assaulting and no prolonging. Again, the idea is to subdue the enemy몭s troops without fighting, take his city without assaulting it, and destroy his country without a long war.
In Sun Tzu몭s philosophy, there is a checklist with three things that you must do before embarking on any undertaking: (1) Think through the risks; (2) Think through the price you몭ll have to pay; (3) Think through how your undertaking will benefit you.
Two things above all else drive people into making mistakes: one is temptation, and the other is anxiety. 
There is a Chinese four-character idiom that describes this aspect of human psychology 멪it translates as, 몬Forgetting principle at the sight of profit.몭 But, this doesn몭t tell the whole story. A more universal version of the idiom would be: 몬Forgetting danger at the sight of profit.몭 For many people, it몭s hard to resist the tantalizing attraction of financial reward, even if it means risking their life. Some people even die for pennies.
Then there몭s anxiety. The reason it forces mistakes is that when people are in an anxious state, they feel a need to do something, anything. When people are in this frame of mind, how can you expect them to wait patiently, and not fight or attack the enemy몭s city? The battlefield is a place that teeters between the worlds of life and death. It is no place for a perennially anxious commander, because when anxiety distorts your every thought, mistakes crop up with alarming ease.
What can you do to avoid making mistakes? The answer is to adopt failure as the premise behind your every thought. Normally, we tend to do the opposite, predicating all our thoughts on the idea of success, because when we do something, the aim is to do it successfully. So, isn몭t it natural to put success at the center of our thinking, planning, policy-making, critical analysis and judgment calls? If your strategy teacher doesn몭t teach you about success, is it really 몬the art of war몭 that they몭re teaching?
Well, The Art of War doesn몭t take this approach, and instead relates everything back to failure. For everything Sun Tzu wrote about achieving, he first hypothesized that the outcome would actually end in failure. His analysis, planning, policy-making and assessments all revolve around avoiding failure, and decreasing any losses you may have to incur. The way things should be done, according to Sun Tzu, is to first set yourself up in a position where you can몭t be defeated, carry out your plan, wait for an opportunity and, finally, resolve the conflict with a single move.
It몭s the same in the business world, and it몭s why a person who has the ability to focus, be consistent, and stay under the radar 멪 while steadily perfecting their particular craft over the course of years 멪 can make it as a leading figure in their industry. Then there are people who are always looking around for something new to do, regularly hopping from one thing to another, and riding the turbulent waves of life as an entrepreneur.  The difference between these two types of people is essentially about their ways of thinking. The former is not necessarily particularly wise; they몭re just people who think a lot about failure, and make it the premise of their planning. They몭re the kind of person who, whenever you tell them about some new idea, tells you that your idea is risky. They first think about new things in terms of how they might fail, and only continue pursuing things they몭ve already experienced some success with. And so, eventually, their work culminates in massive success. On the other hand, the latter type of person 멪 the type who thinks a lot about success 멪 only has ears for opportunity. They believe that big opportunities absolutely cannot be missed, and so they spend their whole lives starting new businesses.
The Hong Kong business magnate Li Ka-shing once said: 몮Whenever you set out to do something, first reflect on failure.몯 This is the fundamental wisdom of 몬the art of war.몭 When we talk about 몬masters,몭 what makes one a master is that they know they몭re the same as everyone else. Thy recognize that at least half of the projects that present themselves will end in failure if attempted, so they몭re extremely cautious. If someone boasts that there몭s nothing they can몭t do, you know they몭re not a master. The only 몬greatness몭 they몭re setting themselves up for is great disappointment.
The last of Sun Tzu몭s three is 몬no prolonging.몭 Basically, this means you should make as few moves as possible, and then, at the crucial moment, play your hand. The worst thing you could do is spend every day trying new things, making new moves, and repeating things you몭ve already done. The more you do, the more mistakes you make.



Concentrate a superior force and aim to annihilate the enemy

Extract from the original text:
몮It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy몭s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide the army9 into two. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.몯

Analysis:
Sun Tzu takes great pains to emphasize the principle of military strength, which means only fighting when you have absolute advantage over your enemy. Only try to surround your enemy if your men outnumber his by ten to one, and only consider making a frontal attack if your men outnumber his by at least five to one. This is the idea behind the title of this chapter, which is a quotation from Mao Zedong. 
If you only outnumber the enemy two to one, you don몭t have absolute advantage, and you should 몮divide the (his) army into two.몯 Manipulate him into cutting his own army in two, because then you can manufacture a position where you have absolute advantage. This is another way to describe Mao Zedong몭s style of mobile warfare. It involved leveraging a large amount of space where battles could potentially happen in order to buy himself time, which he used to maneuver his troops into position and surround the enemy. Mao몭s strategy was one of using absolute advantage to fight quick, decisive battles. He summarized his approach as: 몮Evading the enemy몭s main force, luring the enemy deep into the country, concentrating our own forces in advantageous positions, and destroying the enemy몭s fragmented forces, one piece at a time.몯

몮If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy.몯

If your forces are equally matched with the enemy몭s, and you are unfortunate enough to meet them on the field, determine whether you몭re capable of beating them, and then stand and fight. If not, run as fast as you can and get out of sight. As Mao put it: 몮If you can fight and win, then fight; if not, then run.몯
What will happen if you don't run? 몮Though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.몯 



Divide your enemy몭s army and fight: The method

Extract from the original text:
몮If our forces are ten to the enemy몭s one, surround him; if five to one, attack him; if twice as numerous, divide the army into two.몯

Analysis:
몮If our forces are ten to the enemy몭s one, surround him.몯 Once you have the enemy surrounded, you can force him to surrender, or annihilate his army.
It몭s said that 몬One woman on a city wall can beat ten men outside.몭 The same idea is presented in the ancient military text, the Wei Liaozi: 몮One man becomes as ten men, ten men as a hundred, a hundred as a thousand, and a thousand as ten thousand.몯 If defenders have a ten-to-one advantage, naturally their enemies will need an advantage of at least ten-to-one to stand a chance.
Du Mu elaborates on this, pointing out that to surround the enemy means sealing him in on four sides. The purpose is not only to defeat him, but also to prevent him from escaping. To achieve a full encirclement of the enemy, you몭ll need to choose a place that몭s both far away from the enemy몭s cities and has a wide expanse of open ground. Then, you have to enforce the encirclement by vigilantly guarding the trapped enemy forces. If you don몭t have enough men, there will be gaps in your encirclement, and 몬leaks몭 are bound to happen.

몮If five to one, attack him.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮With five to one, take three as your main force and two as a surprise force.몯 This means that, assuming the enemy has closed his ranks and adopted a defensive position, you should attack with three fifths of your army while keeping two fifths in reserve. And then, later, use your reserves to secure your victory in a surprise attack.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮You must surprise him from the front and harass him from the rear; feint east and strike west. If you do not possess a five-to-one advantage, you will be unable to divide as many of his troops.몯
He Shi comments: 몮If I have five times as many soldiers as the enemy, then I can attack the city walls with three fifths of my forces, and use two fifths to seal victory using my auxiliary force.몯
A good historical example of this in action is the story of Dugu Xin attacking Yuwen Zhonghe in Liang Province, during the time of the Western Wei dynasty.
The Western Wei government had appointed the governor of Yi Province, a man named Shi Ning, to be the new governor of Liang province. But Liang Province몭s resident governor, Yuwen Zhonghe, refused to be replaced and stayed put. Prime Minister Yuwen Tai decided to deal with the situation by sending the prince몭s tutor, Dugu Xin, with an army to put the rebellious ex-governor in his place. As the army advanced, Yuwen Zhonghe holed up behind the walls of the city of Ying. Dugu Xin몭s strategy was to send his generals to the northeast corner of the city wall in the middle of the night with siege ladders, while he led a separate force to attack the southwest corner. By dawn, the city belonged to Dugu Xin, and Yuwen Zhonghe was his prisoner.

If your army is twice as numerous, divide the (enemy몭s) army into two.몯

If you only have twice the troop numbers of the enemy, you don몭t have a big enough advantage, and you need to come up with a way to make the enemy divide his army. In Du Mu몭s commentary, he clarified that Sun Tzu meant that it is the enemy몭s army that should be divided, and not your own. (As noted earlier, the original text in Chinese is so condensed that it could be interpreted either way). Du Mu advises that you should use your army to attack either the enemy몭s weakest point, or attack him where you know he will be unable to resist immediately coming to the rescue. In this way, you can decrease the number of troops available to him, and consolidate your initial two-to-one advantage. Then, it몭ll be much easier to defeat him.
Cao Cao몭s commentary is simpler: 몮If attacking one with two, then use one part as your mainstay, and the other part as the auxiliary force.몯 Cao Cao몭s interpretation of Sun Tzu is different; he reads it as an imperative to divide your own army.
Du Mu argues that the decision to split your army into a main force and an auxiliary force has nothing to do with the relative number of troops commanded by you and your enemy. He says that it몭s an essential part of all wars. As a case in point, when Xiang Yu fought his last battle by the Wu River, he only had 28 cavalry left, but he still split his men into a main force and an auxiliary force. During that battle, his two forces took turns trying to save each other. 
Du Mu was right 멪 the meaning of the original text is that you should divide the enemy몭s army. However, to achieve this, first you have to divide your own army. So, Cao Cao was right too. Cao Cao went into more detail as well, spelling out how many troops should be allocated for different functions. This topic actually constitutes a whole branch of the art of war, known as 몬the art of division.몭 A book by Ming dynasty strategist Liu Bowen, Extraordinary Strategies of a Hundred Battles, contains a chapter devoted to the art of division. Here몭s an excerpt:
몮When fighting your enemy, if my forces are numerous and the enemy몭s few, then I ought to select an open expanse as the site where I will defeat him. If my forces are five times more numerous than the enemy몭s, then I ought to allocate three fifths of my soldiers to be the main force, with the remaining two fifths as an auxiliary force. If my forces are three times more numerous than the enemy몭s, then I ought to allocate two thirds of my soldiers to be the main force, with the remaining one third as an auxiliary force. This can be called 몬blocking him in the front with one half of my forces, while attacking his rear with the other half.몭 The past master10 says: 몬if you do not divide when you ought to divide, you are tying your own hands.몭몯
Cao Cao몭s 몮If attacking one with two, then use one part as your main force, and the other part as the auxiliary force몯 could just as well be added to the text above.
In this chapter, the concept of 몬main forces and auxiliary forces몭 has repeatedly popped up. In fact, it comes from perhaps the most famous line (in China) of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: 몮Use the regular to engage the enemy, and the irregular to defeat him.몯 Here, 몬irregular몭 doesn몭t refer to anything strange or odd, despite the fact that the Chinese character used in the original text usually means 몬extraordinary,몭 or even 몬queer.몭 It simply means 몬forces kept in reserve.몭 While the main forces get the fight started, the commander watches from his command center, waiting for the crucial moment. Then, he orders his reserves to spring into action, sealing his victory.
This topic will be discussed in more detail in Chapter Five: Force. For now, we will put it to one side, closing with a quotation from Jiang Ziya: 몮It is no good talking about the use of auxiliary forces with a general who does not understand the art of dividing troops.몯

몮If twice as numerous, divide the army into two.몯

There are two famous examples of this: one reflecting how it should be done, and the other an instance of how it should not be done.
The example of how it should not be done comes to us courtesy of Emperor Fu Jian of the Former Qin Empire (not to be confused with the Qin Dynasty, which was the first to unify China in a single empire). It몭s the story of Fu Jian몭s catastrophic defeat in the Battle of Fei River, in 383 CE. His fatal mistake was that he didn몭t divide his troops when he should have. He had a ten-to-one advantage 멪  800,000 troops against the opposing Eastern Jin army of 80,000 멪 but he kept his whole army grouped together in a single mass. When the Eastern Jin forces attacked, his army fell into confusion and crumbled.
The example of how it should be done comes from a general of the Liang Dynasty, Wang Sengbian, who used the tactics of troop division to defeat rebel forces commanded by Hou Jing at a battle at Zhanggongzhou.
Wang Sengbian, along with another Liang general named Chen Baxian, lined up their forces opposite those of Hou Jing at Zhanggongzhou. The Liang army몭s battle banners flew high and proud, resplendent against a bright sky. Seeing the flags, Hou Jing felt disheartened. 몮Morale seems high in the Liang army. Let몭s blunt some of their enthusiasm and take away their edge,몯 he said. So, Hou Jing ordered his drummers to drum, and led 10,000 steel-clad cavalry in a direct charge. Chen Baxian turned to Wang Sengbian and quoted a passage from Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: 몮Those who are skilled in war are like the snake of Mount Chang. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail. Strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head.몯 Then, he said: 몮The rebel scum is walking into his own death; he wants this fight. We are many and they are few, so we should divide his forces.몯 Wang Sengbian agreed. From the front, he held the enemy back using his crossbowmen, while attacking it from behind with his more mobile forces. Then, the bulk of his army separated into three groups, and charged straight at Hou Jing몭s forces from three different angles, causing them to collapse. Defeated, Hou Jing fled back behind his city walls. 



The wisdom of admitting defeat

Extract from the original text:
몮If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.몯

Analysis:
몮If equally matched, we can offer battle.몯 If your forces are evenly matched with the enemy몭s, it몭s important that you have the ability to fight.
Cao Cao comments: 몮If the number of one몭s force are equivalent to the enemy몭s, then the skillful general lays an ambush with his irregular troops, and in this way secures victory.몯 So, once again it comes back to a division of duties between 몬regular and irregular troops.몭 The regular troops challenge the enemy head-on, while the irregular troops prepare an ambush. Though Cao Cao doesn몭t spell out here what proportion of troops should be allocated for 몬regular몭 and 몬irregular몭 roles, history tells us that in most cases when generals used this 몬lure and ambush몭 tactic, the main force was actually smaller than the auxiliary force.

몮If slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy.몯

If you have fewer troops than the enemy, don몭t leave your defensive position. Dig deep defensive trenches and put up high walls. Alternatively, conceal yourself so that the enemy doesn몭t know how weak you are, and when you get the chance, run away!

몮If quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.몯

In Du Mu몭s commentary, he explains that if you are weaker than the enemy both in terms of your military strength and the level of support you receive from your allies, you need to escape without delay and flee as far away as possible. If the enemy gets too close to your weak point, it will be too late to run.
Sun Tzu was a conservative, deeply cautious man. He always wanted to win before fighting, and he refused to fight if victory did not seem almost certain. He certainly would never fight if he had fewer men than the enemy. On this point, Sun Tzu doesn몭t conform to certain mainstream values. We love to see an underdog beat a larger opponent, and history seems to be on our side on this, because the books are full of stories of famous underdog victories. So, why exactly shouldn몭t you fight just because the enemy has more men than you?
There몭s a concept from management studies called 몬proof is silent.몭 Cases where one side has held a truly absolute majority, where there has been an absolute probability, tend to happen in silence. Nobody talks about them, so nobody knows about them. On the other hand, people tend to make a lot of noise about low-probability events, where the underdog somehow defeats their more powerful foe. With such loud fanfare, these events are still remembered 1,000 years after they happen. So, as stories of these events have piled up over the course of 3,000 years of Chinese history, they appear much more common than they actually were. They have in fact become a mainstream cultural narrative.
 So, what is 몬silent evidence?몭 First of all, generals who run away because they didn몭t have as many men as their opponent tend to keep quiet about it. It몭s not something people like to publicize. Perhaps it shouldn몭t come as a surprise that none of the 11 great commentators on Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War offered a single historical example of these lines. In fact, they really wrote nothing about it; not even so much as a brief explanation! Zhang Yu did write a short addendum: 몮When the opponent is numerous and I am few, I ought to flee from him.몯  But 멪 and there is an important 몬but몭 멪 Zhang Yu also said: 몮If the enemy is in chaos and I am well ordered, if the enemy is lax and I am vigorous, then even though the enemy may be more numerous than my forces, I can still contend with him in battle.몯 Zhang Yu offered two historical examples: 몮Since Wu Qi destroyed a Qin army with 500 men against 500,000, and Xie Xuan defeated Fu Jian with 8,000 men against a million, what need was there for them to flee?몯
Zhang Yu몭s claim here is equivalent to listening to Sun Tzu tell you that you shouldn몭t try to break a stone with an egg (which he did actually say), and then responding with two examples of someone doing exactly that.
Zhang Yu is advocating a 몬yes, but멞몭 approach here. But, what about you? Could you replicate the things he talked about, defeating a force of 500,000 with only 500 men? A good number of people tend to think that they can be the exception to the rule. After all, every time someone has defied the rule, their story has literally gone down in history. But, propping up each of these success stories is an intricate structure of countless random circumstances. If you몭re missing just one piece, things won몭t go your way.
Today, we can add two more historical examples to illustrate the principles of, 몬If slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.몭 One of them involves 몬silent evidence,몭 and the other is heavy on the fanfare. The one about silent evidence is the story of Shi Dakai, a general of the Taiping Rebellion during the Qing dynasty. His expeditionary force was hemmed in by the pursuing Qing imperial army, and within a year and a half he fought in three different provinces: Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan. After that, he returned to Sichuan and broke through the Qing defensive line at the Yangzi River. In the end, though, he couldn몭t quite get away. He died, and his story ceased to be told. This is the silent evidence: his story does not prove that Zhang Yu몭s words were correct.
The other story, the loud one, is common knowledge. The reason it remains known is that the army involved, once it started running, kept running for 8,000 miles. They got away from their enemies, and at the end of the war they emerged victorious. This is the story of the Red Army몭s Long March (1934-1935 CE). What would have happened if the Red Army didn몭t start running at that crucial juncture in Jiangxi Province?   

몮Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.몯

A classic historical example of this is provided by the Han dynasty General Li Ling. General Li was ordered by Han Wudi to deliver a shipment of grain and fodder, but his pride wouldn몭t allow him to act as a lowly deliveryman. So, he asked permission to lead 5,000 infantry in a direct assault against the Xiongnu royal court. He ended up surrounded by 100,000 Xiongnu cavalry, and surrendered. Han Wudi punished Li몭s failure by executing his entire family, and even Li몭s main cheerleader, court historian Sima Qian, was punished with castration.
Wanting to win is part of being human, but reality reminds us that there몭s always a good chance of losing. So, it몭s important to be able to admit defeat. According to Stan Shih, the founder of Taiwan몭s tech giant Acer Inc, 몮You can only be a winner if you know how to concede defeat.몯 There몭s a lot to this idea. You could also say that only by losing can life keep on going. When we admit that we몭ve lost, we can keep hold of our wins and eventually expand upon them.
Even the renowned Ming dynasty thinker and statesman Wang Yangming 멪 who during his lifetime built a monumentally important body of scholarship and went down in history as one of the four great masters of Confucianism 멪 admitted defeat and stoically withstood the scheming of the palace secret police (몬the embroidered uniform guard몭) as they attempted to frame and provoke him with all kinds of outrageous ploys that also harmed the common folk. He understood that in the dark society of his times, anyone who attempted to extend justice, or even just a helping hand, to the common folk would immediately be pounced upon and destroyed. He acknowledged that this would not do anyone any good. He knew that all he could do was hold back until the secret police saw that they couldn몭t prevail.
So, Wang Yangming accepted defeat for the time being, and waited. He saw that if he waited until he was no longer in a losing position, then by default he would become a winner!



It몭s the emperor몭s prerogative to not understand military Issues, but it몭s imperative for generals to understand politics

Extract from the original text:
몮Now, the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points, the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army: (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions that obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier몭s minds. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.몯

Analysis:
몮The general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points, the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.몯 Here, the words 몬complete몭 and 몬defective몭 have three levels of meaning. On the first level, 몬complete몭 means 몬possessing both wisdom and talent, and having well-rounded abilities,몭 while 몬defective몭 means 몬having gaps in one몭s abilities.몭 On the second level, 몬complete몭 means that 몬the general몭s military arrangements are integrated and watertight, while 몬defective몭 means 몬the general몭s arrangements are full of holes.몭 On the third level, 몬complete몭 means 몬the general몭s plans are complete and carefully kept secret,몭 and safe from leaks, while 몬defective몭 means 몬the general몭s plans are transparent and obvious,몭 allowing the enemy to see and capitalize on your strengths and weaknesses.
We should follow the same principles in our daily activities: we should be fully equipped, keep our plans tight and allow no leaks in our calculations. If you leave any base uncovered 멪 if there몭s just one issue that you haven몭t given adequate consideration to 멪 what you have is a leak, and when it comes down to it, this leak will sink you. If this happens, there몭ll be no point crying out at the injustice: 몬Who knew this would happen?몭
There is an ancient Chinese phrase: 몬Not knowing is not a sin.몯 Totally incorrect! The phrase has it backward 멪 not knowing is the biggest sin of all! If you don몭t know about something, how can you deal with it responsibly?
From here, Sun Tzu outlines the 몬three not knowings몭 that every state leader must avoid. His message is: 몬Yes, you몭re the boss, but you몭re ignoring a few things, because you don몭t know about them.몭
The first 몬not knowing몭 is not knowing that your army is not in a position to advance, and as a result, you force the issue and order them to advance anyway. By the same token, you will be unaware of when your army isn몭t in a position to retreat, and so you force them to retreat when you shouldn몭t. Case in point: During the Tang dynasty몭s massive An Lushan Rebellion, General Geshu Han intended to hold Tongguan Pass against the rebel army. However, because Emperor Xuanzong didn몭t know that Geshu몭s army was in no position to fight a pitched battle, Xuanzong insisted that Geshu do exactly that. What happened? Geshu몭s army was overwhelmed and Tongguan Pass was lost. As a result, the capital city, Chang몭an, fell to the rebels and Emperor Xuanzong was forced to flee south to Sichuan.
Another example: During the Battle of Fei River in 383 CE, General Xie Xuan of Jin told his adversary, Fu Jian of Former Qin, 몮Move your army back a little bit; I몭ll cross the river, and then we can fight it out.몯 Fu Jian was apparently unaware that he absolutely should not retreat, and he did indeed move his troops back. Fu Jian몭s rear units didn몭t know why the forward units seemed to be retreating; all they knew was that they could hear the enemy troops shouting: 몮The Qin are defeated!몯 They thought that their own comrades at the front really had been defeated, so they turned and ran, and that몭s how a false defeat turned into a real one.
Situations like these are what happen when the leader doesn몭t know that life and death hang in the balance with every move his army makes, whether forward or backward. It is about knowing when to stop.
The second 몬not knowing몭 is not knowing anything about military issues, yet still wanting to have a role in the management of your army.
The Methods of the Sima says: 몮Military affairs cannot be allowed to permeate the state, and state affairs cannot be allowed to permeate the military.몯 Ruling a country and commanding an army are two very different games, with very different rules.
The military text Bing Jing says: 몮In state affairs, use words; in military affairs, use deception.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Benevolence and a principled approach can be used to rule a state, but not to command an army; an adaptable approach can be used to command an army, but not to rule a state.몯
Fu Jian, the losing Former Qin commander and Emperor, had bright prospects once upon a time. He was a brilliant and celebrated leader, and the military strength he commanded was unprecedented in his times. But, he was also the kind of person who indulges others, a personality trait that set the tone for the way he acted in his dealings with his enemy, General Xie Xuan. In their relationship, Fu Jian saw himself as the Emperor, and Xie Xuan as his subject. Perhaps he took inspiration from Zhuge Liang, who apparently captured, and then released, his enemy Meng Huo no less than seven times. Fu Jian let Xie Xuan take the initiative, and then, when he captured him, he tried to win him over with persuasion. During Fu Jian몭s erstwhile efforts, he forgot that 몮The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin; Hence, it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.몯 Carelessness must not be tolerated. Because of one lapse of attention, Fu Jian몭s army crumbled, his country collapsed, and he lost his own life. 
In Du Mu몭s commentary, he expresses his opinion that armies have distinct systems of etiquette and command, and can only be handled using military methods and rules. If you try to command an army using the ordinary methods of administrating a state, the soldiers won몭t know what you want them to do. To illustrate his point, Du Mu cites the example set by Han dynasty general Zhou Yafu. When Zhou was stationed in Xiliu, the Emperor, Han Wendi, made an inspection tour of his forces, intending to show his appreciation to the soldiers. At every camp the Emperor visited, the gate guards let him pass as soon as they saw him, and the commanding officers rushed out to greet him. But Zhou Yafu몭s camp was different.
When Han Wendi arrived, he was stopped by the guards and told to wait while someone went to inform Zhou Yajun that he몭d arrived. The guards told the Emperor that they took orders from no one except their general, not even from the Son of Heaven. The Emperor waited for a good while before he was allowed in. Zhou Yafu didn몭t come out to greet him, but just gave a simple message for his men to relay to Han Wendi: 몮Please enter.몯 Zhou even told the emperor that his carriage was not permitted to move too quickly while inside the camp, per military rules. When the Emperor몭s carriage pulled up outside Zhou몭s tent, Zhou stood in the doorway and offered a simple salutation, clasping his hands in front of him and bowing. He told the Emperor that he couldn몭t kneel, because he was wearing armor.
Han Wendi leaned up against the railing of his carriage, and nodded his head admiringly toward Zhou Yafu. From then on, he marked out Zhou Yafu as a general he could rely upon, and on his deathbed, he told his successor, Han Jingdi, that Zhou Yafu should be made use of in the event of any military problems. Han Jingdi took his predecessor몭s advice, and Zhou Yafu went on to successfully put down the major Rebellion of the Seven States.
However, though the example Du Mu chose is a classic, it몭s not entirely apt. This is because, on that day at the Xiliu army camp, there were two important factors in play: Han Wendi몭s moral character, and Zhou Yafu몭s temperament. Zhou Yafu was very self-assured, cocky even, and he didn몭t only behave this way in his own camp. He didn몭t adopt a more deferential manner even when he was called to the imperial palace. Eventually, his behavior made Emperor Jingdi uncomfortable, and because of his lack of judgment he ended up accused of plotting treason. He was an old man by then, but he couldn몭t stand being accused of such a crime, so he chose to go on hunger strike in protest, a choice that proved to be fatal.
The third 몬not knowing몭 is not understanding that in the army, you need to adapt your leadership style to deal with changing circumstances, while still being involved in giving orders. There몭s no getting around the fact that, if the wrong person is in charge, you몭re going to lose. The most classic example of this is from the famous Battle of Changping (262-260 BCE), between the states of Qin and Zhao. The Zhao commander, Zhao Kuo, had no battlefield ability 멪 he was an armchair strategist at best. Zhao몭s fellow general, Lian Po, knew this, the Zhao statesman Ling Xiangru knew, and Zhao Kuo몭s mother knew. Even his dead father knew. Only two people didn몭t know: Zhao Kuo himself, and the King of Zhao. And, in brief, that is how 400,000 Zhao soldiers lost their lives.
Each of the 몬three not knowings몭 comes down this: 몮A general in the field is not subject to orders from his sovereign.몭 They are about the dangers of a ruler trying to directly control their armies. The Zhou dynasty strategist Jiang Ziya said: 몮The state cannot be governed from outside, and an army cannot be commanded from the palace.몯 If a ruler constantly tries to control his armies from afar, 몮The armies will be driven into a state of confusion and doubt, and the feudal lords will be subjected to great difficulties.몯 When this happens to a state, its enemies are able to exploit the confusion and slip in through the cracks. When you throw your own army into disorder, you몭re inviting the enemy in and giving victory away.

몮A general in the field is not subject to orders from his sovereign.몯

These words were meant for the ears of rulers, but an erstwhile advisor can never assume that the ruler will actually listen. The best they can do is try to open the ruler몭s eyes to the truth of these words. If he refuses to accept that truth, they still have to obey his orders. A general who doesn몭t obey his ruler doesn몭t tend to stay alive for long, and if he can몭t protect his own life, how can he protect his country? Then, what몭s the use in being considered a hero? A good example is the famous and highly celebrated Song dynasty martyr, General Yue Fei, who died because he refused to accept that the Emperor wouldn몭t listen to him. To this day, he is a Chinese national hero. People lionize him, and in the same breath they demonize Qin Hui, who is characterized as a treacherous courtier who betrayed Yue Fei. And yet, this doesn몭t change the fact that the Song dynasty was destroyed. Yue Fei몭s decisions compromised his duty to care for his country.
A counter-example would be the Qin General Wang Jian. The Qin king entrusted him with an enormous, 100,000멨strong army, which he used to eliminate six states in a row and unify all of China. He knew he had to reassure the King that he didn몭t have royal ambitions of his own, so he would frequently send messengers to the royal court asking for small favors. For example, one day he would ask for a few fields, and the next day he몭d ask for a simple house. In contrast, Yue Fei had a habit of doing and saying things that the Emperor found threatening, such as his ambition to rescue the two former Song Emperors who had been captured by their northern Jurchen enemies. How could he have expected Emperor Gaozong to tolerate this? What did he expect Gaozong to do if he came back with two other Emperors? How would Gaozong know that Yue Fei wouldn몭t pledge allegiance to one of them over him?
So, while it몭s acceptable for an Emperor to not understand military issues, it absolutely is not acceptable for a general to not understand politics.
The words 몬a general in the field is not subject to orders from his sovereign몭 are meant as advice for rulers, but it can never be assumed that an Emperor or King will understand the importance of this rule. The understanding has to come from the ruler; all an advisor can do is guide them to realize it.



Nothing is more difficult than getting judgment calls right

Extract from the original text:
몮Thus, we may know that there are five factors for knowing victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.몯

Analysis:
Here, Sun Tzu is talking about ways of knowing victory, not acquiring victory. This is another demonstration of the idea that you can know ahead of time who몭s going to win, but you can몭t just make victory happen. It몭s about not going to the battlefield in the hope that fortune will favor you and bring victory. It몭s about fighting a single, decisive battle when you already know that victory is assured. So, the first of these five factors is about knowing when you can fight and when you cannot 멪 before you make any moves, you need to know whether or not you can win.
This is a lot to ask of a general몭s ability to make sound judgment calls. How do you know when victory is a sure thing? If you always think you몭re going to win, and if you do indeed win time after time, wouldn몭t that make you a demigod? 
My own experience in the world of work is this: it몭s impossible to know whether you몭re definitely going to win, but it is possible to know when you몭re definitely going to lose.
For example, if you몭re tasked with drawing up a project plan, your most important skill is not creativity. Rather, it몭s an ability to make good judgment calls, as well as a clear grasp of where you are at any given point in the project, and knowing whether or not you몭re on track to successful completion. Being able to make good judgment calls is a prerequisite to creativity, and it몭s important to true creativity. Without this ability, creativity disengages from reality and floats off into an undefined, nebulous zone. How do you deal with this kind of creativity? The Han dynasty Grand Historian, Sima Qian, had this answer: 몮When a madman speaks, the sage seriously considers his words.몯 In other words, call in someone else to make a judgment for you.
There are some things that people believe only because they hope they몭re true 멪 wishful thinking is a human weakness. Let몭s suppose that wishful thinking accounts for 30% of any given judgment call. Having said that, whenever you feel a high degree of certainty about something, first subtract 30% of that certainty, and reevaluate. If you feel 100% sure of something, you get a revised certainty of 70% after subtracting the 몬wishful thinking몭 factor. Assuming that our judgment is accurate, there몭s a 50% probability of winning 멪 very good prospects indeed.
Success happens occasionally, but failure is always there, all but inevitable. It몭s important to understand this, and to not act rashly.
Knowing victory and defeat is just another way of saying evaluating the situation before 몬going to battle.몭 And the results will just automatically happen the way you몭ve called them, right? Actually, no. Wars end in victory or defeat, but that몭s not the case in business! Often, you don몭t know what the result is even after the 몬fight몭 has been 몬fought.몭 Sometimes, the results seem to show that you몭ve won, when in fact you몭ve just suffered a massive loss. Why?
The reason is that losses are often concealed; they can lie low for a long time, before finally reemerging and dealing you a crippling blow. It works like this: when someone starts a business, success and failure seem very obvious in the way they present themselves. Wins present as goals that have been achieved, while failures present as projects that end up costing you money. But, once a business is up and running, it몭s perfectly possible that you could make a crucial error, and yet your revenues keep on growing. By the time your market share starts to come down, you might not think that you몭ve done anything wrong, perhaps blaming it on your product having exhausted its life cycle.
Nothing is more difficult that making judgment calls and getting them right.



How many troops you can command depends on how strong your management skills are

Extract from the original text: 
몮Thus, we may know that there are five factors for knowing victory: (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.몯

Analysis:
Every line of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War is densely packed with information, and this one is no exception. The idea here, in the second of the 몬Five factors for knowing victory,몭 is that if you understand the different uses of both large and small numbers of troops, you have the ability to be a leader of men and armies. Broadly speaking, to unpack the meaning of this line we need to look at it from three different perspectives:
1) Do you know how many soldiers you need?

Example: King Zheng of Qin (the man who eventually became the First Emperor of all China) was intent on destroying the state of Chu, so he called a court meeting of all his ministers, and asked them how many men and horses would be needed to take Chu. One minister, Wang Jian, said: 몮Without 600,000 men, it cannot be done.몯 Li Xin disagreed: 몮A force of 200,000 is all that will be needed to defeat Chu.몯 King Zheng naturally preferred Li Xin몭s answer, and dismissed Wang Jian as an addled old man, no longer fit for use. The King named Li Xin and another general, Meng Tian, commanders of a 200,000-strong army, and sent them south to attack Chu. They lost, badly. Seven high-ranking Qin officers were killed, and the debacle stands out in history as one of the few major defeats suffered by Qin.

The first thing the Qin King did was apologize to Wang Jian, and then he invited him to lead a new army and fight Qin몭s enemies. Wang agreed, on the condition that he would be given 600,000 men.
	
Wang led his army into the state of Chu, set up camp and stayed put. He showed no interest in starting any fights, and instead spent his time running athletic competitions for his men. The Chu army was outnumbered, and they knew they were in position to attack, but after a year passed with no sign of action, the Chu forces became restless and began moving around much more often. Gaps soon opened in their defenses, and Wang Jian wasted no time 멪 he pounced, and in no time at all the state of Chu came undone.

When the Xiongnu leader, Modun, wrote that highly improper letter to Empress Lu, the first thought that came into the furious Empress몭 mind was to send out troops to punish the chieftain for his impertinence. In the imperial court, General Fan Kuai got quite carried away by the excitement of the occasion and, eager to answer the Empress몭 call, dramatically proclaimed: 몮Give me 100,000 men and horses, and I will wipe the Xiongnu from the maps!몯 He wasn몭t the only one; everyone seemed to be jumping on the war wagon. But then, Li Bu shouted over all the other voices: 몮Fan Kuai, you should be executed for such a suggestion! Do you forget that our late lord the Emperor once led a host of over 400,000 men against the Xiongnu, and yet he was surrounded at Baideng? It was only by the grace of Chen Ping몭s silver tongue that the enemy allowed Emperor Gaozu safe passage home. But you 멪 do you consider yourself superior to Gaozu?몯 

Empress Lu soon recovered her cool, and decided the best response was to write back to Modun instead of fighting him. Her letter, which we detailed earlier, was well balanced 멪 neither submissive nor overbearing 멪 which allowed her to maintain a friendly, peaceful relationship with her powerful Xiongnu neighbors.

2) How many soldiers are you capable of leading?

This is a skill that touches on management, organization and mobilization abilities. How many men can you lead? A squad? A company? A platoon? Perhaps an entire army? 

Liu Bang once gathered his most trusted followers and held a discussion about how many troops each of them was capable of leading. He asked Han Xin how many he thought that he, Liu Bang, could command. Han Xin replied that he thought Liu Bang몭s limit was 100,000 men 멪  any more than that and he wouldn몭t be able to get the job done. Then Liu Bang asked: 몮Han Xin, what about you? How many troops could you lead?몯 Han Xin replied: 몮Well, since it몭s me you몭re talking about, the more the merrier! I can take as many as you can give me.몯

Organizational and managerial skills are, as a topic of conversation, somewhat dull. They몭re not the kind of thing people relish talking about, unlike certain other personal attributes associated with war. For instance, everyone likes stories about leaders who had a knack for stratagems, or great courage. This is compelling stuff, and so, naturally, it is these stories that spread wide and far.
	
But which of these things made Han Xin so talented in the art of war? Why did he rise above his peers? Of course, he was certainly a very cunning strategist, but he was not courageous 멪 this is considered his weakness. He also had a superpower. Look no further than his words to Liu Bang: 몮The more the merrier!몯 What if you asked yourself, what몭s the biggest team I could lead? Managing a company of 20 people and managing a company of 200 are very different things. It몭s a different thing again to lead 2,000, 20,000 or 200,000. Some organizations might even manage a million people, like Foxconn. Unfortunately, the electronics manufacturer몭s management methods drove their employees mad, even to the point of suicide. On the other hand, we have the example of the Qin general Wang Jian, who managed to run a military camp of 600,000 men for a whole year with no battles to keep them busy, only daily athletic competitions. Yet, at the crucial moment, he was able to deliver a killing blow to the enemy. The fact that he was able to avoid any major disasters, while managing 600,000 young men living in close quarters without much to occupy them, is a testament to his incredible talent for management.

3)  How do you lead soldiers? How do you use them?

Here, we can borrow a principle from Chapter Five: 몮The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men.몯 This is what Han Xin was talking about: you could give him 100 men to lead, or a 100,000, and he would be equally at ease in both situations. He could do this is because he had a whole organizational framework and various management systems he could call upon. This is a topic that is discussed in later chapters (Chapter Four: Tactical Dispositions; Chapter Five: Energy; and Chapter Six: Weak Points and Strong).
	
Organizational framework is about designing different types of fighting units, from the smallest to the largest. As we몭ve noted, the smallest unit used in ancient Chinese warfare consisted of five men. By the Ming dynasty, General Qi Jiguang, who was famous for defeating the infamous wokou pirates, designed a 몬Mandarin Duck Unit몭 consisting of 20 men. In the 20th century, Communist Party General Lin Biao invented an organizational formula: 몬One point, two sides, three threes.몭 Lin Biao was a masterful commander, directing his men as if they were an extension of his own arm, from the smallest units of three men to huge armies of over a million soldiers.

This is what Sun Tzu meant when he wrote: 몮The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men.몯

Analysis:
Now we move on to the third of the 몬five factors for knowing victory.몭
If you asked commanders if they understood what it means that 몬He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks,몭 they would all say 몬yes.몭 But, if you think about it in terms of Ming dynasty philosopher Wang Yangming몭s theory of the unity of knowledge and action, you can몭t really know what it means unless you몭ve actually done it. By these standards, almost nobody really knows what it means.
Unsurprisingly, when people try to put it into action, they start with their own desires and demand that other people conform. In general, you see people in higher positions trying to force their desires upon people in lower positions. Very rarely do people understand that the right thing to do conforms to the desires of others. 
The Neo-Confucianists spoke of 몬preserving the patterns of heaven, and destroying the desires of mankind,몭 while Wang Yangming said: 몮The patterns of heaven are the desires of mankind.몯 But these are two different types of desire. The former is personal desire, and 몬destroying몭 it simply means 몬controlling몭 it. The latter is communal desire, and Wang Yangming was saying that people should conform to this communal desire.
There is a passage from an ancient narrative history text, The Zuo Commentary, that reads: 몮It is admissible to follow men by using a desire, but if men are used to follow a desire, then success is a rare thing.몯 This means that you can achieve success by aligning your aspirations with those of a larger group of people, but if you make a group of people follow your own, personal desire, success will be hard to come by.
In fact, we might edit the original text, from 몮He will win whose army is animated by the same desire throughout both the upper and lower ranks,몯 to 몬He will win who aligns himself with the desires of others.몭

This takes us back to a truism: benefitting others is the same as benefitting yourself.
If you몭re an employee and you want to make quick progress, you should always analyze any problem you face from your boss몭s perspective.
In any business relationship, you should always try to put yourself in the shoes of the other party몭s boss. Sincerity works magic; it몭s the key to business stability.
If you몭re a boss, you need to be able to think like an employee. You need to see everything from their perspective, take an active interest in them, and put yourself at their service. If you can do that, you will find people willing to work with you.
If you몭re a business, you need to see things through the eyes of consumers. Rather than trying to make money by exploiting an imbalance in information access, focus on building a solid product and service structure on behalf of consumers. Do what others won몭t, and you몭ll have a brand that can last a hundred years.

몮He will win whose army is animated by the same desire throughout both the upper and lower ranks.몯

So, how is that done?
First, you need to admit that the upper and lower ranks do not share the same desires. Only when you몭ve done this will you be able to think of a way to unify them. If your starting point is a belief that everyone else should conform to you, and that there몭s nothing you need to do, it won몭t work. People will never truly conform to your way.
The Warring States period Legalist philosopher, Han Feizi, touched upon this in his writings, but he used a different wording from Sun Tzu: 몮Rulers and minsters cherishing divergent interests.몯
During the Three Kingdoms period, when Cao Cao attacked the state of Eastern Wu, the Eastern Wu King, Sun Quan, called a meeting with his minsters. He asked then: 몮Should we fight, or surrender?몯 The ministers몭 response was unanimous: 몮We cannot beat Cao Cao. Even General Liu Cong surrendered to him, and he was well prepared. But us? Forget about it. We should surrender, and then focus on negotiating terms.몯
But one Eastern Wu statesman, Lu Su, had other ideas. When Sun Quan left the courtroom for a moment to answer nature몭s call, Lu Su seized his chance to make a pitch to the King: 몮My lord, it does not matter for us ministers if we surrender, but you cannot.몯 Sun Quan asked him why, and he replied: 몮We몭re advisors 멪 even if there몭s a new lord, we몭ll still carry on as before, working in our official posts. If you surrender, then our assets and salaries will be safe, but what about you? What official post would you be eligible for?몯
Now, Sun Quan understood. He had to fight.
This is what it means for rulers and ministers to have different interests. So, what몭s the solution? And what몭s the solution for divided desires between 몬the upper and the lower ranks?몭
According to Han Feizi몭s logic, the answer is to develop a transactional relationship between a ruler and his ministers. In other words, build incentive mechanisms, which should be fair and transparent. Then, there몭s no need for rulers to be inherently benevolent, or for ministers to be loyal, because the incentives will automatically steer rulers toward benevolent kindness and ministers toward courageous loyalty.
In ruler-minister relations, there몭s no room for acting on emotion, whether love, respect, kindness or any of a long list of similar sentiments. What몭s crucial is that everyone must be loyal to the responsibility they hold within their individual role. They must be loyal to their job and to the rules of the game.
With well-designed incentives, even if everyone who works for you is essentially a bad person, it won몭t matter, because their impulse to follow their own interests will only cause them to do good. In terms of building your advisors몭 moral fiber, you just need to promote the idea that everyone should act the way good people act, and give credit to people who demonstrate especially good behavior. If you do this, you will be able to unite the desires of the upper and lower ranks as one, and you will win.



Properly understand the meaning of 몬Just in case멞몭

Extract from the original text:
몮Thus, we may know that there are five factors for knowing victory: (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.몯

Analysis:
Now let몭s take a look at the fourth of the 몬five factors for knowing victory.몭
The word in the original Chinese text corresponding to 몬prepare몭 is a rarely used, archaic character, which means 몬to make defensive preparations in advance.몭 It features in a modern Chinese four-character idiom, which means 몬two people deceive one another,몭 with the root meaning being: 몬two people make preparations against one another.몭
The ancient text, The Zuo Commentary, says: 몮He who makes no preparations in advance must not command soldiers.몯 Likewise, a passage from Chapter Eight of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War reads: 몮The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy몭s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.몯 
At one time during the Spring and Autumn period, the states of Wu and Chu were at war against one another. The two armies were positioned thirty li apart, but a rainstorm came that lasted ten days and ten nights. At night, there was total darkness, with no stars to light the sky. 
The Chu commander, Yi Xiang, held a meeting with Chu General Zi Qi.  몮With such terrible weather,몯 the commander said, 몮the Wu army no doubt believes that we have not made the proper defensive preparations. They will attempt a surprise attack, I am sure of it. The best course of action for us would be to prepare accordingly.몯
Sure enough, a Wu surprise attack didn몭t take long to materialize. But, when the Wu forces saw the Chu army arrayed in full defensive formation, they realized they held no advantage and quickly retreated. The Chu army didn몭t pursue them, because Yi Xiang knew that the Wu forces would have been prepared for that eventuality. Instead, he waited until the Wu army had retreated back to their camp, and then he made his move.
몮They have now marched a total of 60 li on their way here and back to their camp, so they will be tired and hungry. Their general will want to rest, and the soldiers will want to eat, so their defenses will be loose. If we quietly march our forces the 30 li to their camp, I am sure we can defeat them with a single, sharp blow,몯 Yi Xiang reasoned. And he was right 멪 his plan worked perfectly, and the Wu army suffered a massive defeat.
But theoretically, what would Yi Xiang have done if the Wu army didn몭t try their surprise attack? It was raining heavily, and his army was set up in a defensive formation. Wouldn몭t his effort have been wasted? It몭s normal to hear people say words to the effect of. 몬I wasted my time; all my preparation was for nothing.몭몯 This is exactly the kind of thinking that the idea of 몬the art of war몭 aims to dispel. The classic military text, One Hundred Sayings on the Art of War, puts it like this: 몮It is preferable to make preparations that are unused, rather than to not make preparations with the result that the enemy profits thereby.몯 
These advance preparations go 몬unused몭 in the vast majority of cases, because they are, by nature, made for 몬just in case몭 scenarios. They몭re a back-up, not the main plan. This means that for every example of such preparations working out with good effect, there are 9,999 cases of preparations going 몬unused.몭 The Chu commander, Yi Xiang, was by no means blessed with supernatural powers of foresight 멪 he had no way of knowing that the Wu army would come; he was just following standard operating procedure. That몭s why he prepared the way he did. If the Wu army hadn몭t showed up, the Chu soldiers would have grumbled for a while, and then things would have moved on. That day certainly wouldn몭t have found its way into the history books, and we wouldn몭t even know what happened. But the Wu army did attack, and that몭s why Yi Xiang몭s name has lived on for over 2,000 years. The very fact that this story has lasted so long goes to show how rarely things like this actually happen.
A friend of mine who works for the French petroleum company, Total, once told me that in any company meeting, there몭s always a safety officer present, and the meeting always starts with a half-hour safety presentation. It covers things like where the fire escapes are, emergency exits, the overall layout of whatever hotel the meeting is taking place in, locations of fire extinguishers, step-by-step instructions for evacuating the building, how to save yourself in different situations, how to help colleagues, first aid information, and so on.
From the perspective of pragmatic, mainstream values 멪 which put progress first, quality second, and safety third 멪 these tedious safety briefings are a colossal waste of time, especially because everyone there has likely heard it hundreds of times before!
But, this is where you need to really understand what 몬just in case몭 means. In Chinese, 몬just in case몭 is literally 몬one in ten thousand,몭 and that몭s what we몭re talking about here 멪 being prepared for a one-in-10,000 outcome! How many parents who drive cars don몭t bother with a child seat for their babies, because they don몭t think anything will go wrong? Clearly, they haven몭t considered the fact that if a one-in-10,000 event happens, their child will be gone. That몭s why whenever I travel with my child, I always take a child seat with me.
Another way to understand the idea of, 몬He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared,몭 is to put it like this: 몬Opportunity belongs to he who is prepared.몭 Life is constantly setting the scene for new situations. If you embrace the idea of this passage, you will be ready for opportunity when it arrives.
War is fleeting, and 99% of our work is preparation. There몭s deep meaning in this. Yet, it몭s so easy for people to see only the benefits or losses that war might bring them. That몭s why more time and resources are allocated to gathering the fruits of war than to preparing for war. But, you should be thinking about sowing seeds, not getting ahead of yourself and focusing on the harvest. I have observed certain entrepreneurs delegating 몬harvesting몭 work to their managerial staff, because today몭s harvest is the product of seeds that they sowed three years earlier. Meanwhile, the entrepreneur focuses all his attention and energy on the next round of sowing; he몭s preparing for the future.



The boss should let go of his judgments, where appropriate; employees should let the boss cross workplace boundaries

Extract from the original text:
몮Thus, we may know that there are five factors for knowing victory: (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign. These five factors are the way to know who will win.몯 

Analysis:
We have now reached the last of the 몬five factors for knowing victory.몭 The Methods of the Sima says: 몮Advancing and retreating are decisions to be made according to the situation, not by dictate of the ruler.몯 
When the forces of Cao Cao몭s general, Sima Yi, were lined up against Zhuge Liang on the Wuzhang Plain, Sima Yi refused to fight. Day after day, Zhuge Liang launched tirades of insults against Sima Yi, including, as we몭ve noted, allegedly sending him a 몬gift몭 of women몭s clothing. Sima Yi몭s men were outraged by this humiliation, and began to suspect that Sima Yi was a coward. In one soldier after another, the desire to fight grew stronger. Sima Yi responded by telling them: 몮Alright, I will immediately request authorization from the Emperor to attack.몯 
Sima YI sent a letter to Cao Cao몭s court, but when they received it, they knew exactly what his real intentions were: he was just putting on a show, and he needed Cao Cao to play along. Cao Cao obliged, sending an imperial envoy named Xin Pi to Sima Yi몭s camp. Xin Pi stood at the camp몭s gate and announced an imperial decree to the soldiers: 몮Any man who presumes to inquire about attacking the enemy shall be executed!몯
When Zhuge Liang got wind of this, he said: 몮If Sima Yi was really capable of handling me, would he have written to his Emperor asking permission to fight? He몭s just pretending that the Emperor won몭t let him fight, because he몭s worthless as a leader!몯
By saying this, Zhuge Liang was referring directly to this chapter몭s passage from Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: 몮He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.몯 If Sima Yi wanted his ruler to interfere, that meant he didn몭t have any 몬military capacity.몭
However, Sima Yi몭s request for interference was a ploy 멪 he was play-acting. Zhuge Liang knew this, and he never did succeed in starting the fight he wanted so badly at Wuzhang Plain. Instead, he fell ill and died while still in camp. 
In ancient China, there was a ceremony by which the ruler would bestow his authority on his commander-in-chief. It centered on a ceremonial axe, which represented power over the lives and deaths of all subordinates, and the power to punish the ruler몭s enemies. The axe itself was not designed for battle, but for executions 멪 specifically, by beheading and by cutting people in half at the waist. In the ceremony, the ruler would hold the axe by the blade and, holding the handle out toward the general, say the following words: 몮Everything reaching from here up into the highest heavens shall be given into the general몭s power.몯 Then, the ruler would take the axe by the handle, hold out the blade toward the general, and decree: 몮Everything reaching from here down into the deepest recesses of the earth shall be given into the general몭s power.몯  This is how the Emperor passes his all-encompassing power over everything, from the heavens down to the earth, to the general.
몮He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign,몯 and the general shall not be dictated to from afar by the ruler. When people are lectured about the art of war, they naturally believe that this passage is correct. But in reality, it몭s describing an idealized state of affairs, which rarely crosses the boundary into objective reality. Things generally did not go well for generals who stubbornly insisted on this ideal 멪 many of them ended up dying horrific deaths.
From a general몭s position, they have to manage every detail of army life, and they also have to deal with the overwhelming minutiae and variables of battlefield situations as they develop in real-time. It몭s not surprising, then, that there몭s no way they could ask the ruler몭s permission for every move they make. But, it몭s not easier for the ruler either. Compared with his generals, the pressure a ruler has to deal with is significantly heavier. Rulers have to manage the ins and outs of politics, internal policy, diplomacy, hostile foreign states, armed rebels and other insider political foes. On top of that, the ruler has to hand over all his chips to his general. If a ruler can resist the temptation to send a supervisor to watch over his generals, he몭s already doing quite well, given the pressure he몭s under. If you want a ruler to not manage his generals in any way, and referain from asking them any questions, he몭d collapse into an anxiety-wracked mess.

몮The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence, it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.몯

When a ruler is walking the line between life and death, you can몭t ask them not to speak their mind or interfere in military campaigns. This is because, with every passing moment, the ruler is constantly making judgment-calls.
Rulers should learn when it몭s appropriate to let go of their judgment; they should be able to exercise self-control. For example, during the Tang dynasty몭s An Lushan Rebellion, Tang general Geshu Han was holding a strong defensive position at Tongguan Pass, and his situation appeared to be improving after half a year of refusing to be drawn out of his fortress and into a pitched battle. Despite this, Emperor Xuanzong forced Geshu Han to go out and fight. Why did Xuanzong make this judgment call? Why did he think it was a good idea to fight out in the open? One reason was his pride. He could not accept the fact that An Lushan had rebelled against him, let alone the possibility that the rebel general could defeat him. That몭s why Xuanzong executed his two best generals, Feng Changqing and Gao Xianzhi, who had lost battles against the rebels. Xuanzong몭s behavior was an act of self-sabotage. Now that he could see the tide was turning in his favor at Tongguan Pass, Xuanzong was anxious to destroy An Lushan as soon as possible, like waving away an unpleasant smell. Another reason was that Emperor Xuanzong몭s advisor, Yang Guozhong, was fanning the flames. He was a sworn enemy of Geshu Han 멪 whatever Geshu Han wanted to do, Yang would tell the Emperor to do the exact opposite.
Emperor Xuanzong was not capable of making clear, critical judgment calls. He mostly acted on his emotions. He couldn몭t accept the idea of failure or being humiliated, so he felt an urgent need to remove the possibility of these outcomes every materializing, and to do so as quickly as possible.
Yang Guozhong slandered Geshu Han: 몮Since Geshu Han is taking such pains to convince us that he cannot fight, then even if we listen to him, what good will it do to wait for another half year? Would that really make a difference?몯 Yang whispered in the Emperor몭s ear, and his cajoling worked. Xuanzong became ever more assured that he was making the right decision.
Of course, the result of all this was that when Geshu Han obligingly led his troops out of the fortress, his entire army was decimated, the Tang capital was lost, and Xuanzong fled to Sichuan. Yang Guozhong was killed by outraged soldiers, along with his cousin Yang Guifei, an imperial courtesan with whom Xuanzong had been besotted.
Geshu Han몭s greatest 몬inability몭 in all of this was his failure to make Xuanzong trust him. Because of this, he had no claim to having 몬military capacity.몭 At the root of his failure was his vicious feud with Yang Guozhong. Yang may have been a contemptible kind of person, but sometimes 몬men of distinction몭 nonetheless have to put that aside and maintain friendly relations with such people. At the very least, you have to be aware of this idea, even if you can몭t bring yourself to actually be friends with people you despise. Many talented minsters and advisors achieved great things by relying on good relations with otherwise unpleasant palace eunuchs 멪 for example, Ming dynasty reformer Zhang Juzheng.
Rulers need to consider this chapter몭s passage carefully. Then, they will realize that being overly eager to kill or be killed could quickly lead to irreversible defeat, and that there몭s no harm in letting go of some of the executive decision-making and trusting the generals to take care of business themselves.
If you몭re a general, you should resist the temptation to swat away the ruler몭s hand whenever he tries to get involved. Instead, allow him access whenever he wants. Make sure he sees you as someone who is totally transparent, who would never try to keep him at a distance. If you do this, you몭ll be able to reason with the ruler more persuasively when that crucial moment comes and you absolutely have to take full control of the situation.



Know yourself and know your enemy. Problems usually arise from not knowing yourself, rather than not knowing your enemy

Extract from the original text:
몮Hence, the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.몯

Analysis:
If you know yourself and your enemy, you can set yourself up in a position where failure is impossible. Knowing yourself and your enemy means that you clearly understand your own situation, and the enemy몭s, in terms of each of the 몬Five factors for knowing victory.몭 And, you will understand exactly how your situation compares with the enemy몭s. But, if you only understand yourself and not your enemy, your odds of victory immediately plummet to 50%. Worst of all, if you don몭t understand yourself or your enemy, your odds are zero. 
For an example of someone who knew themselves but not their enemy, look no further than Li Quan몭s commentary. He offers the case of the former Qin Emperor Fu Jian, and the Battle of Fei River.
When the former Qin statesman, Wang Meng, lay on his deathbed, he gave Fu Jian some advice: 몮Although the Jin court is located in the remote lands south of the Yangzi River, their bloodline is pure. The Jin generals Xian An and Huan Chong are powerful men, and we should not attack them. Our true enemies are here, in our midst 멪 the Xianbei and the Qiang, all wretched northern barbarians. They will ultimately be our undoing, unless we do what is good for the country and expel them from among us.몯
But Fu Jian didn몭t listen, and after Wang Meng died, he led an army to invade Jin. Even with the wheels already in motion, people tried to talk Fu Jian out of it: 몮We몭re not the only ones with talented generals,몯 his advisors argued. 몮They have Xie An and Huan Chong, both brilliant commanders. We mustn몭t underestimate them!몯
Fu Jian remained adamant: 몮I command the multitudes of eight provinces, and have in my possession a million men and horses. My armies are large enough to hold back the Yangzi River! What difficulty exists that I cannot overcome?몯
In fact, he was marching into a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Fei River. Afterward, the Xianbei and Qiang people did indeed revolt, and Fu Jian was murdered by the Qiang chief, Yao Chang.
In retrospect, was Li Quan right? Was Fu Jian몭s fatal error knowing himself, but not knowing his enemy? Not at all. His problem wasn몭t that he didn몭t know the enemy, but that there were internal dynamics in his own camp that he didn몭t understand. He didn몭t realize that he was effectively bunking with his mortal enemies.
Some doubt remains about the accuracy of the historical records I quoted above about Wang Meng몭s advice to Fu Jian. It doesn몭t ring entirely true that Wang would have said that the reason the Jin shouldn몭t be attacked was that they had a 몬pure bloodline.몭 Fu Jian was himself not purely Han Chinese, and it몭s unlikely that people of ethnic minority background would believe it was dangerous to attack someone just because they were 몬pure몭 Han Chinese. Remember, though, that Chinese history is written by Han Chinese historians of 몬pure bloodlines,몭 and it몭s very likely this line is an editorial intervention.
Anyway, the important part was Wang Meng몭s second line, where he said that the non-Chinese Xianbei and Qiang peoples were the real enemies, and that they should be destroyed.
But Fu Jian had one, massive character flaw: he was too kind, and his kindness lacked principle. Anyone else, having conquered another state, would make sure they finished the job, pulling up the enemy by the roots. Not Fu Jian. As far as he was concerned, as long as the enemy surrenders, their former Emperor would be welcome to fight under his flag as a general. He was indiscriminately open-hearted.
This flaw explains why Fu Jian had already failed one of the 몬Five factors for knowing victory몭 멪 몮He will win whose army is animated by the same desire throughout both the upper and lower ranks.몯 His vast ranks comprised a million men, but they were divided in spirit. Vanquished Emperors and Generals of defeated states who served under Fu Jian still harbored dreams of restoring their fallen kingdoms, and they certainly had no intention of helping Fu Jian in his bid to conquer all of China and found a new empire. That몭s why, when Fu Jian몭s men heard the enemy shouting that their comrades were retreating, they all turned tail and fled.
Among the states conquered by Fu Jian was Former Yan. The Former Yan prince, a Xianbei boy named Murong Chong, was taken to Fu Jian몭s palace along with his older sister, who was fourteen at the time. His sister became a favorite concubine of Fu Jian, and Murong himself became a male concubine, so brother and sister both were moved into the imperial harem. Later in life, Murong Chong yearned to reestablish his old kingdom, but he ended up serving in Fu Jian몭s army. When Fu Jian saw him one day at the front, the old Emperor was overcome with emotion, and had a servant take a brocaded gown over to Murong Chong. This was just one more humiliation for a man who had once been a prince, who had lost his country and his family at the hands of this man, and who together with his sister had been bundled off into the enemy몭s harem. Yet, Fu Jian never thought there was anything but love between them! He was convinced that he was the undisputed lord of the whole world; that몭s what made him absurd. He had no idea that other people might also fancy themselves Emperor. 
Let몭s critique Fu Jian in terms of each of the 몬five factors for knowing victory.몭 
몮He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.몯 Wang Meng specifically warned Fu Jian that his real problems were internal, and that it would not be a good idea to start a war with the Jin rulers. Fu Jian didn몭t get it.
몮He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.몯 On this point, Fu Jian was just sloppy. He didn몭t bother dividing his huge army into different units, but massed them together in one huge heap. That몭s why Fu Jian몭s order to retreat triggered his army몭s total collapse.
몮He will win whose army is animated by the same desire throughout both the upper and lower ranks.몯 We몭ve already addressed this point: many of the generals who supposedly served him were actually just waiting for a chance to restore their own nations and declare themselves Emperor.
몮He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared.몯 Xie Xuan carefully designed a trap for Fu Jian, who believed he didn몭t have anything to fear, regardless of what traps his enemies might have set. So, he didn몭t prepare. That몭s how he found himself on the back foot and getting punched in the mouth.
몮He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.몯 In this case, Fu Jian was both the Emperor and the general in the field. He led a million men, but they could be more accurately described as a mob than an army, each with their own subversive motives.
Fu Jian didn몭t meet the standards of any of the five factors. So, he started out with a 100% chance of failure, rather than the 50% odds that he would have enjoyed if he knew himself but not the enemy.
We often focus on knowing our enemies, because we take it as a given that we know ourselves. But reality often says otherwise. Our problems generally come from the fact that we don몭t know ourselves. In practice, if you can몭t quite work out your enemies, how are you supposed to understand other peoples몭 situations?
The Tang Emperor Taizong specifically commented on this point with reference to Fu Jian: 몮Though the generals and advisors of today may not be capable of knowing their enemies, but what of Fu Jian? If he had been able to know himself, how could he have fallen into such an unfavourable position?몯
I believe that if you know yourself, but not the enemy, your odds of victory aren몭t just 50%, but 80%. You should definitely make sure you put in the hard yards when it comes to knowing yourself. My attitude is: 몬I don몭t care what your situation is, because that몭s out of my control. I only care about what my situation is, because then I몭ll be prepared for you regardless. More than that, I몭ll be able to twist you around my little finger.몭 In my readings of Zeng Guofan몭s Complete Works, I몭ve found very few journal entries containing specific details about his enemies. Instead, he mostly wrote technical reflections on his own work as he built up and managed his army. 
You only find out the truth about the enemy몭s situation after you몭ve already fought them.
There몭s another question you have to think about when you apply Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War to modern business management: Who is the 몬enemy몭 in 몬know yourself and know your enemy?몭 
It몭s not your competitors! In fact, your 몬enemy몭 is your clients. If you know yourself and you know your clients, you are guaranteed to win every battle you fight. Business management problems normally happen when you haven몭t properly done the work you need to on yourself, and on top of that you don몭t understand your clients. If what you take from the art of war is that you should spend every day studying your so-called enemy, you몭re just wasting your time and your effort.



Appendix: Complete text of Planning Assaults

Sun Tzu said: 몮In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy몭s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is second best. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entirely than to destroy it, to capture a battalion, a company or a squad entire, than to destroy them. Hence, to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy몭s resistance without fighting. Thus, the highest form of generalship is to attack the enemy몭s plans; the next best is to attack the enemy몭s alliances; the next in order is to attack the enemy몭s army in the field. Besieging walled cities is an option chosen only when nothing else is successful. The preparation of mantlets, armored wagons, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, with the result that one-third of his men are slain while the city still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege. Therefore, the skillful leader subdues the enemy몭s troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field. With his forces intact, he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem. It is the rule in war: if our forces are ten to the enemy몭s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide the army11 into two. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force. If our forces are ten to the enemy몭s one, surround him; if five to one, attack him; if twice as numerous, divide the army into two. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force. Now, the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army: (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions that obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldiers몭 minds. (3) By employing the officers of his army without[bd12] discrimination, through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away. Thus we may know that there are five factors for knowing victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same desire throughout both the upper and lower ranks. (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign. These five factors are the way to know who will win. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.몯



Chapter Four
Formations

Win first, fight later

Extract from the original text:
몮The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself. Thus, the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy. Hence the saying: One may know how to obtain victory without being able to achieve it.몯

Analysis:
There is a connection between Chapter Four of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War (Formation) and Chapter Five (Force). These two words, 몬formation몭 멪 of which the root meaning in Chinese is simply 몬shape몭 멪 and 몬force몭 combine in modern Chinese to form a word with a range of meanings. They range from 몬terrain몭 to 몬power몭 to 몬situation.몭 It is a word that traces its origins directly to The Art of War. So, what is the meaning of 몬formation몭 here?
Cao Cao comments: 몮It is the shape of an army; I move, the enemy reacts. It is two enemies analyzing each other몭s situation.몯
Formation is something that can be observed. It몭s about making moves and watching how the enemy responds; it몭s about probing and observing one another. It몭s similar to a widely known concept in modern Chinese known as 몬reconnaissance by fire.몭 The idea is to take a couple of shots at the enemy, and see what shape or formation it exposes.
Zhang Yu also takes a shot at explaining the idea of 몬formation.몭 He said the following: 몮It is the shape of two armies, one attacking and the other defending. When it is hidden within, then the enemy cannot determine what it is; when it is visible from outside, then the enemy can infiltrate through the cracks.몯 
Both sides do all that they can to not allow the enemy to probe their formation. Once battle commences, one side becomes the attacker and the other the defender, and then the two armies몭 formations are exposed to each other.
So, 몬formation몭 is a stage before a battle starts, while 몬energy몭 is a topic for when battles have already gone live.
The Han dynasty scholar-official Xun Yue wrote about 몬formation몭 and 몬energy몭 in the same passage:
몮There are three essentials in the art of establishing policies and obtaining victory: 1) Formation; 2) Force; 3) Circumstances. In general, formation is about calculations of what may be gained and what may be lost. Force is about that which is appropriate in the moment-to-moment situation of a battle, and it is about opportunities for advancing and retreating. Circumstances are about whether or not, in truth, one몭s will is within the realm of possibility. Thus, the fact that results differ even when policies and events are the same is because of differences in the use of these three arts.몯
So, 몬formation몭 is about calculating gains and losses, and your odds of victory can be calculated. You should act only once you are clear about the calculations; if you몭re not clear, don몭t move.
Before you do anything, take a good look at the formations and work out if you몭re in a viable situation. Xun Yue also said that once the wheels are in motion, you need to rely on force. This isn몭t wrong, but Sun Tzu discusses the topic in much more detail in Chapter five. Finally, Xun Yue also mentioned 몬circumstances.몭 When he talks about 몬one몭s will,몭 he몭s referring to the commander-in-chief몭s willpower, but also to his men몭s morale, and whether or not it몭s 몬in the realm of possibility.몭 In The Art of War, 몬circumstances몭 are categorized as part of 몬force,몭 so Xun Yue몭s 몬three essentials몭 are actually only two: 몬formation몭 and 몬force.몭
Once you몭ve got your head around these two topics, the whole process of fighting and winning battles boils down to the two processes of 몬winning formation몭 and 몬winning force.몭 Now, let몭s start reading through Chapter Four: Formation, which is all about winning through the use of 몬formations.몭

몮The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself. Thus, the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy. Hence the saying: One may know how to obtain victory without being able to achieve it.몯

Ancient generals who were truly skilled in fighting wars would start with themselves, first making thorough plans so as to put themselves in a position where they can몭t be beaten. Then, they would wait for the right time and opportunity to defeat their enemy. Being unbeatable is down to you; being able to beat your enemy is down to whether or not the enemy gives you the opportunity to win. By this logic, generals skillful in the art of war had the ability to make themselves undefeatable, but not to guarantee certain victory over their enemy. Victory can be foreseen, but it can몭t be forced if the conditions aren몭t right.
There is a parallel between, 몮The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy,몯 and a passage from the previous chapter: 몮If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.몯 Making your own plans such that your enemy can몭t defeat you is the same as 몬knowing yourself,몭 and waiting until the enemy can be defeated is the same as 몬knowing your enemy.몭

몮To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself. Thus, the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.몯

In short, you can control yourself, but not others. First, get your affairs in order, and then observe others. If the enemy has no weak point for us to attack, there몭s nothing we can do to secure victory.

몮One may know how to obtain victory without being able to achieve it.몯

We can, through critical evaluation, determine that we are capable of winning, but if we don몭t have winning formation and force, we can몭t make it happen.
What are you supposed to do if you can몭t win, given that victory can몭t be forced?
The first thing to do is not do anything. So many people lose because they don몭t know that it몭s possible to leave situations unresolved. There몭s a Chinese saying that sums this up quite aptly: 몬If you go looking for ways to die, you몭re going to die.몭 If there몭s something you can몭t do, don몭t try to force it. That몭s because, as another Chinese saying reminds us, 몬As long as the green hills last, there몭ll always be wood for your stove.몭 In other words, if you insist on forcing a resolution, you몭ll end up losing all of your leverage.
If victory is beyond reach, don몭t fight. Reel it back, focus on yourself, and focus on training. Sun Tzu몭s philosophy is to secure victory first and go to battle later, and we haven몭t seen the last of this idea. It comes up again later in the text, where I rephrased it as, 몬Win first, fight later.몭 If you haven몭t won yet, don몭t fight.
Many people can몭t accept this idea. In their eyes, it means negligence; they have to always be doing something, because that몭s the only way they can feel at peace.  This mentality is a kind of 몬strategy-based anxiety,몭 and you see it when people forget that there몭s always another side to any action 멪  there몭s always a trade-off, there몭s always risk, and there몭s always something lost. In reality, not making a move doesn몭t mean that you몭re being negligent. Rather, it means that you몭re building yourself up and waiting for the opportune moment. In the War of the Three Kingdoms, Zhuge Liang was constantly doing things. It could fairly be said that he kept making moves even when the odds of victory were absolutely 몬zero,몭 and in the end he wore himself out so badly that he died of exhaustion. He should have waited for opportunities, and he should have worked out and kept his body healthy. There are two good reasons for doing this: 1) He would have lived longer; 2) He could have governed better, made his nation rich and powerful, and taught his son the lessons he needed to be well-prepared to carry on his legacy.
But, like so many others, Zhuge Liang thought he couldn몭t afford to wait. And what happens when you can몭t wait? Sima Yi lived longer than any of the other major players: he outlived Zhuge Liang, he outlived Cao Cao, and he even outlived Cao Cao몭s son and successor, Cao Pi. With no one left to stand in his way, Sima Yi몭s state of Jin took control of all three kingdoms.
That몭s why the second strategy is 몬waiting.몭 It몭s the best choice in many situations, and yet far too few people understand this. What you몭re waiting for is a change in circumstances 멪 specifically, for advantageous changes in formation and force.
A 몬winning formation몭 is something that gradually builds up while you wait. It몭s about making it impossible for the enemy to defeat you, and gradually growing stronger. 몬Winning force몭 is about seizing the opportunity for victory when it presents itself, and thoroughly defeating your enemy with a single blow.
No one was better at waiting than Japan몭s Tokugawa Ieyasu, who[bd13] emerged victorious from Japan몭s war-torn Sengoku period (1467-1615 CE). 
There몭s an amusing story about the three major heroes of the Sengoku period: The three 멪 Tokugawa Ieyasu, Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi 멪 were in a park with their pet bird, but the bird wouldn몭t sing. They tried to work out what to do about this.
Oda Nobunaga said: 몮If it keeps on not singing, we should just kill it and get another bird.몯
Toyotomi Hideyoshi said: 몮No need to kill it 멪 we should give it a reward if its sings, and punish it if it doesn몭t. It몭ll sing, one way or another.몯
Then the two men asked Tokugawa Ieyasu what he thought, and he said: 몮There몭s no need to do anything. Just wait! It몭s a bird, after all, and sooner or later it몭ll sing.몯
Tokugawa Ieyasu was the only one of the three who had the ability to wait, and he was also the longest-lived, so he ended up as Shogun of all Japan. His dynasty ruled Japan for the next 300 years.
Again, what are you supposed to wait for? 몬Winning formation,몭 meaning that you몭re waiting for yourself to built up to a certain point?  Or, 몬winning force,몭 meaning waiting for your enemy to make a mistake? As soon as the enemy slips up, an opportunity for victory presents itself. If the enemy doesn몭t slip up, there몭s either nothing we can do to win, or the tradeoff involved in winning would be unacceptably costly. In both cases, you몭re better off waiting and calculating.
And this is why we have the third strategy 멪 can we lure the enemy into making a mistake?
This is what the Tang Emperor Taizong was talking about in Questions and Replies between Emperor Taizong of Tang and Duke Li of Wei, when he said: 몮Through my readings of military books, both ancient and new, I have discovered there is but one crucial teaching 멪 use a multitude of diverse methods to fool one몭s foe.몯

In a previous chapter I told the story of how the Qin General Wang Jian destroyed the state of Chu, in which he asked the King of Qin for a great army of 600,000 men, which he was duly given. He then crossed the border into Chu, and stopped. He didn몭t launch an offensive, but instead set up camp, built defensive walls around it, and then spent every day training his soldiers in athletics. All the while, he was waiting for Chu to make the first move. He had to wait for a year, but finally the Chu leaders couldn몭t bear it any longer, and began moving their forces around, trying to provoke Wang Jian. But in their movements, Wang Jian saw an opportunity. He struck a single, deadly blow, and the state of Chu ceased to exist.



To succeed, you need large-scale, long-term accumulation. If you do this, you can live in a way that transcends the limits of other people몭s imaginations

Extract from the original text:
몮Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking displays a superabundance of strength. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus, on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.몯

Analysis:
몮Security against defeat implies defensive tactics.몯 The commentator He Shi explains it like this: 몮Having not seen any pattern or weakness within the enemy몭s formation and force that might lead to your victory, then defend your position staunchly.몯
Cao Cao limits his commentary to just five words in the original Chinese: 몮This means concealing your formation.몯 If, having surveyed the enemy몭s formation, I find no opportunity for victory, I need to conceal my own army몭s formation and establish a defensive position. It몭s important to not let the enemy find any weakness he could exploit.

몮Ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮If the enemy몭s formation is such that he may be defeated, then you ought to march forth and attack.몯 An excellent example of the first two lines of this passage is one we have already discussed: the story of the Qin general Wang Jian destroying the state of Chu. He marched right up to Chu몭s front door, so to speak, with 600,000 men no less, but when he saw that the Chu armies were lined up waiting for him, he stopped and promptly took up a defensive position. He stayed on the defensive for a year, until the Chu army twitched, exposing a weakness in their defensive line (i.e., a beatable formation). Wang Jian attacked immediately, winning in a single move.
  
몮Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.몯

Sun Tzu몭s philosophy is nothing if not consistently cautious. 몮Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength몯 is about knowing when you몭re not strong enough, and adopting a defensive position. How much strength do you need if you want to attack? In a word, you need a 몬superabundance.몭 It몭s not enough to have just 몬sufficient몭 strength; you need to leave some leeway. Actually, you need a lot of leeway; you need to hold an overwhelming advantage, and only then should you attack.


몮The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven.몯

Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Here, 몬recesses of the earth몭 means 몬deep beyond knowing,몭 and 몬the topmost heights of heaven몭 means 몬high beyond measure.몭몯
Du Mu comments: 몮When defending, cover up your words and erase your footprints, be as shadowy as a ghost. Underground, you cannot be seen. When attacking, move swiftly and in force, with terrible momentum. Be as fast as lightning, and attack as though dropping from the sky; then the enemy will have no way to prepare.몯
So, those who are skilled at defending conceal themselves 몬in the recesses of the earth,몭 so that their enemy is left knowing nothing. Those who are skilled at attacking know how to fill the sky with thunder and strike like lightning. Then, the enemy has neither the chance to react nor the strength to fight back.

몮Thus, on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete.몯 

If you are capable of defending, you can protect the completeness of your forces. If you are capable of attacking, you can secure a completeness victory.
The 몬complete몭 in Sun Tzu몭s philosophy of complete victory isn몭t just about keeping your forces intact and whole. It몭s also about keeping your cities and resources intact and undamaged, and preserving your enemy몭s assets as well. 
First, take care of your own forces. Don몭t kill 1,000 of the enemy몭s troops if it means sacrificing 800 of your own. Second, try your best not to damage the enemy몭s forces and assets. Don몭t defeat the enemy only to watch him destroy bridges, roads, cities and other infrastructure, and burn his granaries and other resources as he retreats. You need to make sure none of these things get damaged, so that they can serve you later. Ideally, you also wouldn몭t kill any of the enemy몭s men. You can take away their will to fight if you몭re able to descend from the sky like lightning. They몭ll lay down their weapons and surrender, and they can join your army, making your forces all the more robust.
Please do not think that defending means being conservative or not trying to make progress.
Defending is, in essence, a way of accumulating the means to victory. In fact, it몭s a way of accelerating the process!
In terms of business management, a simple analogy for these principles would be specialization versus diversification. Every time you enter a new field, you몭re on the attack. Conversely, any time you do a deep dive into a certain field, you몭re in 몬protection mode.몭 Early in the career of Chinese businessman Wang Shi, he sold off all of his companies except for his real estate business, which he protected and ultimately nurtured into China몭s biggest real estate enterprise, China Vanke.
On a personal level, the ability to master anything you turn your hand to comes from concentration and persistence. Any person can become an expert in any field within five years, as long as they focus entirely on that one field. Within ten years, they can become a respected authority in the field, and within 15 they can be the best in the world.
In business, if you lock down on one thing and grow your operation into a world-class organization, you can live beyond the limits of other people몭s imaginations. So, 몬defending몭 is about moving from quantitative change to qualitative change. It몭s about concealing yourself deep 몬in the recesses of the earth,몭 so that nobody knows how deep your waters truly are, because they have never gone as deep into anything as you have. You몭ve become their highest competitive barrier, and nobody else can get around you.
So, what about the line: 몮He who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven.몯 What does it mean? It means that when you think your enemy is attacking you, they actually aren몭t. The principle is similar to a concept invented by Chinese science-fiction phenomenon Liu Cixin, known as an 몬inter-dimensional strike.몭 It몭s a technology that can destroy your enemies without being directly connected to them in any way.
Being in the 몬topmost heights of heaven몭 means that you and your enemy are not on the same level; you몭re operating from a different platform. You몭re not even really fighting on the same battlefield.
In today몭s business world, every online company has to use mobile internet technology 멪 it몭s the price of admission. But there몭s no ticket office where you can buy admission; you have to create your own version of an entrance ticket. Every company몭s logic is different, and everyone is working from a different platform, on their own issues. This being so, is there any meaning in talking about 몬competition?몭  
So, what is competition? In essence, it몭s about making sure that your enemies can몭t compete with you. What it몭s not about is trying to compete against others. This is what Sun Tzu meant when he wrote: 몮Those who are skilled in war first make themselves undefeatable.몯 It몭s also what this passage from the Tao Te Ching means: 몮Nobody in the world can compete against one who does not engage in competition.몯 If you reach the point where you are considering competing against someone, you have already lost. Someone whose launch-point is in the 몬topmost heavens몭 doesn몭t even see themselves as competing against anyone. The way they would see it, wherever they move, they trail a strong wind in their wake, and 몬competitors몭 are just people who are blown over by that wind. Of course, the 몬competitors몭 do see it as competition, and are left believing that their possessions have been snatched away.
When you are deep in the 몬recesses of the earth,몭 you need to endure long, lonely periods of silence, and you have to be able to watch other people who attract more attention and seem better-off than you without losing your cool. Modern examples of this include technology company Huawei몭s decision early on to not enter the real estate sector, and online commerce giant Alibaba몭s decision to hone its core capabilities instead of jumping straight into gaming. If you bide your time and gradually build and grow, when you suddenly burst onto the scene, as far as everyone else is concerned, you몭ll be like Sun Tzu 몬flashing forth from the topmost heights of heaven.몭 People will want to learn from your success, and to do that they몭ll need to hop in a time machine and go back ten years, or even further back, to when you were in kindergarten. Basically, it몭ll be impossible for people to 몬learn몭 from you. When they look at you from outside, what they see won몭t be the reasons for your success, because you몭re already living beyond the limits of other people몭s imaginations.



What makes a general truly wise? Normally, only the general himself knows the answer 

Extract from the original text:
몮To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, 몭Well done!몭 To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning easy battles. Hence, his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.  Hence, the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.몯

Analysis:
몮To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.몯 If everyone else can clearly see a victory in the making, the fact that you몭re also able to see it doesn몭t make you a talented commander.
Cao Cao contributes a very brief comment: 몮Better to see it before it sprouts.몯 Only if you have the insight to see something that isn몭t obvious can you be considered a talented commander.
몮You몭ve got to look at the results! Results give you the clearest picture!몯 This is a pretty common idea when it comes to critical evaluation. But, in reality, results aren몭t necessarily a good way to truly understand a problem. This is because today몭s results are a product of yesterday몭s policies. If you use a different policy, the results might end up better or worse, but nobody can go back in time and try again. Also, everyone has different ways of understanding and explaining results. What we need to be talking about is our judgments about the future. Of course, there몭s a massive gap between different people몭s views of what the future will bring.
Li Quan comments: 몮There is no skill in having knowledge that is no different from the knowledge of common people.몯
If what you can see is the same as what everyone else can see, that doesn몭t count as talent. You need to be able to see things that other people can몭t.
General Han Xin destroyed the state of Zhao at the famous Battle of Jingxing. At dawn, before the battle, Han Xin led his troops through Jingxing Pass. He announced to his army what time they would eat breakfast, and that by the time breakfast began, they would already have destroyed the Zhao forces. Han Xin몭s officers didn몭t believe him, but of course they pretended to, and all shouted: 몮Yes sir!몯 
Han Xin lined his army up with their backs to the Tao River.  When the Zhao general saw that his enemies had nowhere to run, he began laughing loudly. Han Xin had been right 멪 he defeated the Zhao forces in a single assault, and just as the battle was ending it was time for breakfast. 
This is a case of a general knowing something that the common people didn몭t.
What exactly did Han Xin know? First, he knew that by lining up his army with their backs to a river, they몭d be without an escape route, so they몭d fight with the conviction that comes from knowing defeat would mean certain death. Second, he knew how to shatter the morale of the Zhao troops and send them running for their lives, ragged and scared. As soon as the battle started, he sent 2,000 cavalry to attack the Zhao camp, tear down their banners, replace them with Han banners, and shout at the top of their voices: 몮The Zhao army is defeated!몯

몮Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, 몬Well done!몭몯

If the whole world collectively pats you on the back when you win, that means one thing: you haven몭t reached 몬the acme of excellence.몭
This means that by Sun Tzu몭s standards, Han Xin몭s famous 몬victory by the river몭 cannot be considered truly great. The reason is that an army winning a battle with its back to the river is not the kind of thing that happens very often, and this means that it몭s an inherently a dicey situation. By way of counter example, suppose you have an army of 10,000 men, and you defeat an enemy who has 200,000 men. Such a stunning victory is bound to become famous, and everyone everywhere is sure to tell you how amazing you are. Even 2,000 years later, historians will be citing your story as an example of some point they몭re trying to make. On the other hand, if you have a massive army of 200,000 men, and you squash a much smaller enemy force of 10,000, no one몭s going to bother writing down your story. A mere 10,000 men defeating 200,000 is a very low-probability event, so how do some generals actually achieve such unusual triumphs? Actually, it몭s more about trusting to luck and relying on your enemy몭s stupidity.
This is true of Han Xin몭s victory against Zhao. Considering the situation he started from, winning was always going to be a tall order. While Han Xin was still leading his army through the mountains toward Jingxing Pass, his enemy, Lord Guangwu of Zhao, tried to give some tactical advice to the Zhao commander, Chen Yu:
몮The mountain road to Jingxing is very narrow, allowing no more than two war chariots to proceed abreast. The path is too narrow for cavalry to ride in formation, and it extends over a distance of several hundred li, so the enemy supply wagons will have no choice but to fall far behind the rest of the army. Give me 30,000 men, and I will lead them along a small, hidden path through the mountains, and intercept the enemy몭s supplies. Then, you can build sturdy fortifications in the field, and refuse to come out to fight. Thus, the enemy will be stranded in the wilderness 멪 unable to move forward by fighting against you, and without a road of retreat. Without anything for them to eat or plunder, it will take less than ten days for Han Xin몭s head to be delivered to your tent.몯
But Chen Yu didn몭t listen. Han Xin몭s intel informed him of Lord Guangwu몭s plan, and he also learned that Chen Yu did not intend to put it into action. That몭s why he was willing to press ahead through the mountains. Before the battle, Han Xin ordered his men to capture Lord Guangwu and bring him to him, alive. He made it clear that Guangwu was not to be harmed. When Han Xin몭s men delivered Lord Guangwu to him, Han Xin personally untied the ropes that bound his hands, bowed to him, and respectfully addressed him as his 몬master.몭 Lord Guangwu replied deferentially, 몮A defeated general dares not praise himself.몯
Han Xin then said: 몮The ancient general Baili Xi once served the state of Yu, but Yu was destroyed. Then, Baili Xi travelled to Qin, and because of his talent, Qin grew ever more dominant. This does not mean that the Baili who served Yu was a fool who somehow became wise after moving to Qin. No, the truth is that his first master did not use him or listen to him, but his second master did. This is also the case with Chen Yu 멪 if he had used your plan, our current situation would be reversed, and I would be your prisoner. But, precisely because he did not use you, I now have the good fortune to be of service to you!몯 
Soon afterward, Han Xin used a plan devised by Lord Guangwu to force the state of Yan to surrender.
If we switch our perspective on the Battle of Jingxing and look at it from the Zhao point of view, Chen Yu wasn몭t actually beaten by Han Xin, but by himself. In the words of Lord Guangwu, Chen Yu had an 몬unassailable formula for victory,몭 and yet Chen Yu declined to use it. From the moment he made that decision, he had already lost. Just by giving Han Xin safe passage through Jingxing Pass, he guaranteed that nothing could stand in the way of the Han army. As for the bit about Han Xin announcing to his men what time breakfast would be served, this is exactly the kind of delectable detail that storytellers know is sure to delight audiences. When this sort of tidbit is repeated, it몭s equivalent to 몬the whole Empire saying, Well Done!몭 As far as the practical side of war goes, what time an army eats its meals isn몭t relevant.
We should be especially wary of stories like this 멪 tales of victories that have gained the public몭s unqualified seal of approval. You might think you can replicate these great feats, but you몭ll find that things start to go wrong as soon as you try. Han Xin won with his back to the water, but if you try to do the same, you might end up feeding the fishes instead.

몮To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.몯

Being able to lift a single hair doesn몭t make you strong; being able to see the sun and the moon doesn몭t make you sharp-sighted; being able to hear thunder doesn몭t make you keen of hearing. 

몮What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning easy battles. Hence, his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.몯

Those who are truly skilled in war win exclusively against enemies who are easy pickings, or even against enemies who are already beaten. Is there any argument that this isn몭t true of Han Xin몭s victory against Zhao at the Battle of Jingxing?
This line in particular bears repeating: 몮Conquer an enemy that is already defeated.몯 Truly skillful generals don몭t beat their enemies! They attack only once they can see when their enemy is already beaten.
That몭s why none of the truly skillful generals have a place in the ranks of history몭s most well regarded generals. What does a general have to do to become famous? One sure-fire way is to win an 몬unwinnable몭 battle to make your name really last down through the generations. Examples include Xiang Yu, and the Han dynasty general Li Guang, who was a scourge of the Xiongnu. Meanwhile, the truly capable generals were those who were always thoroughly prepared, who did things by the book, and who never made mistakes.
What about Sun Tzu himself? Does he count as a 몬famous general?몭 He몭s certainly famous, but his fame comes mainly from the book he wrote, and history hasn몭t preserved any accounts of the battles he fought. But his contemporary, Wu Zixu, who also served as a general for the state of Wu, is the very definition of a mega-famous general. During his life, he was acclaimed as a once-in-a-generation talent, and after he died, his memory remained a towering presence. Sun Zixu몭s whole life was an epic drama, full of feuding, vengeance and blood. Embroiled in an inter-generational bloodbath, he killed his enemies to avenge his father, and eventually he lost his own life in similar circumstances. Meanwhile, we have no detailed stories about Sun Tzu몭s life, or how he died, although presumably he passed away in the comfort of his own bed. That would certainly explain the lack of a theatrical death-story, ? la Wu Zixu. All we know is that Sun Tzu made important contributions as a general of the state of Wu.

몮Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.몯

This passage cuts to the essence. Skillful generals aren몭t famous for their wisdom, so they can몭t be accused of being too clever for their own good. Likewise, they몭re not famous for their bravery, and so they can몭t be said to be too brave for their own good. Why? Cao Cao comments: 몮If the enemy몭s formation is not fully-formed, defeating him brings no glory; it몭s not impressive.몯
The same principle is at play in a saying about Chinese medicine: 몬The supreme doctor cures patients who are not yet ill.몯 Doctors can become famous by bringing a patient back from the brink of death. We몭ve all heard it before: 몬He was knocking on death몭s door, but somehow the doctor brought him back to life!몭 This is what it means to have a reputation for wisdom and bravery. But, what if every terminal patient were handed over to this one doctor? Would he or she be able to save all of them?
That몭s why the highest level a doctor can reach isn몭t status as a 몬famous doctor,몭 but the distinction of being a 몬supreme doctor.몭 The very best doctors treat illnesses before they even happen. They can see the first signs of a developing sickness, and nip it in the bud by devising a course of preventative treatment, allowing you to sidestep the part where you actually get sick.
But there몭s a problem here: where몭s the proof that you were actually going to get sick? What if the doctor몭s tricking you? Was it really because of their treatment that you didn몭t get sick? The doctor can know the answers, but you never will. There are things that are only known to exceptional people, and to the heavens. Reporters can몭t write a story on these cases; they can몭t say that this person was going to get diabetes, but in the end they didn몭t, and it was entirely thanks to their doctor.
That몭s why a truly exceptional doctor will never become famous. This is also the story of the famous Warring States period doctor, Bian Que, and his two brothers.
Duke Wen of Wei summoned Bian Que, and asked him: 몮There are three brothers in your family. Which of you is most skilled in the arts of medicine?몯
Bian Que replied: 몮My eldest brother is the best, my second-eldest brother is slightly worse, and I am the worst of the three.몯
Duke Wen was confused by this answer, so Bian Que explained: 몮My eldest brother cures illnesses before they manifest any symptoms 멪 before even the patient knows that they are sick. He prescribes medicines to root out the causes of the illness, and so his medical skills have not been widely recognized. Even in our village, the people there do not think highly of him. That is why his name is not well known. Only our family members understand that he is the most talented of all of us.
몮As for my second-eldest brother, his skill lies in prescribing medicines to cure illnesses when they are still in the early stages, before the symptoms have made clear what the illness is. At this stage, the patient usually is not experiencing any pain or discomfort. The people of our village think he몭s capable of curing certain minor illnesses, and so he has a small degree of fame in the area where we live, but people in neighboring villages do not know who he is.
몮As for me, the way I work tends to make a bigger noise, so to speak. I am only able to treat illnesses once the symptoms have become very severe and the patient is in agony. In these conditions, the patient몭s family members naturally feel extremely anxious, and so they watch as I put needles in the patient몭s meridian points and let their blood, or apply poultices to wounds so as to attack the poison within their bodies. And they see how my gravely ill patients are cured, or at least gain some relief. And that is why I am famous around the world.몯
Famous generals are much like famous doctors, in that they win when it seems like nobody could possibly win. But truly skillful generals never fight hard battles, battles that merit dramatic retellings to teary-eyed audiences. Skillful generals stick to easy fights.
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Great wisdom is not commended, and great merit is not widely talked about. What bravery or wisdom is there in the ability to see fine details and win easy victories?몯
He Shi says: 몮If you cure an illness before it has formed, who will call you wise? If you subdue the enemy without fighting, who will call you brave?몯
You don몭t get recognition if people don몭t know what you몭ve done.
This is why some unethical people wait and do nothing, even when they can clearly see a problem that needs to be solved. They know that if they wait until the problem has festered to the point that no one else can deal with it, they can jump in and be the hero who saves the day. The reason they don몭t act sooner is that they몭re only interested in doing things that people can see, and which will bring them praise.
This approach leads to unnecessary risk and loss. So, what do you do about it? Basically, nothing. You just have to rely on your boss몭s wisdom. A good boss has to have the ability to see things clearly, just like Liu Bang. When he finally unified all of China, and staged a grand ceremony to mark the beginning of the Han dynasty, he gave out noble titles to his various advisors and generals. But he heaped the highest accolades on his counselor, Xiao He, much to the chagrin of certain generals who proudly considered themselves brave warriors. They protested, saying that they had soaked themselves in blood on the battlefields and put their bodies on the line, while Xiao He stayed safely at home. They wanted to know how he could be honored more highly than them. Liu Bang responded by asking them if they몭d ever seen hunters at work. He explained that the way hunters work is by planning out routes ahead of time, and then releasing their dogs once they detect their prey몭s tracks. Liu Bang told them that they were his 몬esteemed dogs,몭 while Xiao He was his 몬esteemed hunter.몭 Then, he asked them who should be rewarded more highly.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Secret plans operate unseen, and victory is obtained by invisible means, so the people of the world do not hear about the wisdom which leads to the enemy몭s defeat, and they do not see the feats that lead to enemy flags and heads falling, and the minister who stays at home does not taste the glory of the battlefield.몯 
Here, the 몬minister who stays at home몭 refers to Liu Bang몭s other 몬esteemed hunter,몭 Zhang Liang.
Generally speaking, nobody knows about the achievements of generals who are truly wise, except the generals themselves. That is, unless they have a boss as clear-sighted as Liu Bang. So, to be a wise general, you have to get used to feeling left out. Anyway, who asked you to be so wise in the first place?



The innermost core of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: Win first, fight later

Extract from the original text:
몮Hence, the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.몯

Analysis:
몮Hence, the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.몯
Two armies reach a standoff 멪 what next? First things first: get your own affairs in order. Set yourself up in a position where you can몭t be beaten. Of course, your opponent will also be familiar with the art of war, including the principle of establishing oneself in a 몬position which makes defeat impossible.몭 The difference will come down to who slips up first. If neither side makes a mistake, you몭ll have to wait out a long stalemate. In this scenario, the winner will be whoever has more food and fodder. In the meantime, you might still win a swift victory 멪 if the enemy ever reveals the slightest hint of a gap in their armor, strike instantly and mercilessly, and the day will be yours.
몮To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands.몯 Setting yourself up in a position where you can몭t be beaten is entirely up to you, and has nothing to do with anyone else.
몮The opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy.몯 Keep watching the enemy until he makes a mistake.
These are the principles behind a passage from Questions and Replies between Emperor Taizong of Tang and Duke Li of Wei: 몮From ancient times until the present, all victories and defeats have been the product of nothing more than one mistake. One analogy would be the game of go 멪 in go, a single mistake cascades across the board, bringing utter defeat.
All it takes is one mistake. If your enemy seizes on your error, no amount of talent on your part will save you. On the other hand, if your enemy is an idiot, and doesn몭t notice your mistake, the game continues with one mistake triggering another, as both sides trade blows. This ensures heavy casualties, and plenty of tragic stories after the event.
In the real world of work, pretty much everyone is an idiot, and for the most part, the quality of play is fairly low all around. There몭s a saying: 몬The reason we몭ve made it this far isn몭t because we몭ve done a good job, but because we didn몭t do as badly as our competitors.몭 Every successful person had experiences like this, because they know that their performance hasn몭t always been particularly great. Yet, somehow, they몭ve become a 몬great master.몭
When your enemy makes a mistake, don몭t miss it. If it몭s clear they몭re not going to make a mistake, of course you shouldn몭t sit around waiting for nothing; you have to lure them into tripping over their own feet. This is why Emperor Taizong claimed that everything there is to know about the art of war comes down to one sentence: 몮Use a multitude of diverse methods to fool one몭s foe.몯 In war, there can never be too much deception. All possible variations on 몬deception in war몭 are available to browse in Chapter One:
몮All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy, spreading disorder. Then, crush him. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.몯
Everyone knows that military leaders don몭t shy away from deception, but this commonly accepted fact is also the source of a common misconception. Namely, that deception is at the heart of the art of war, to the point that war is deception, and deception is war. But this isn몭t true. In war, deception is exclusively used to manipulate the enemy and make them go where you want. It is by no means fundamental to managing your own business. If your enemy doesn몭t fall for your tricks, deception won몭t serve you. Likewise, if you don몭t fall for your enemy몭s tricks, his attempt at deception has been nothing more than a useless piece of theater. The real heart of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War isn몭t found in deception, but in this single line:
몮Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.몯
Winning armies always set themselves up to win. They secure the means of victory, and only then do they fight. On the other hand, losing armies invariably rush into fights, hoping they몭ll be lucky enough to stumble upon an opportunity to win in the heat of the battle.
Winning first and fighting later is about abiding by the rule of fighting only once you몭ve gained an overwhelming advantage, and it몭s about refusing to trust the idea of luck. This is Sun Tzu몭s philosophy.
Some people might object to this philosophy, on the grounds that this approach to war is only workable for the strong: if you몭re weak, how are you supposed to gain an overwhelming advantage? If you몭re starting a business, how are you supposed to set yourself up in a position where failure becomes impossible?
The problem with this objection is that it몭s based on a misunderstanding. Sun Tzu몭s philosophy isn몭t just for the strong; it몭s universal. If you몭re weak, you can still gain an overwhelming advantage 멪 the way to do it is to maneuver into a situation where you have a 몬local advantage.몭 It몭s the same concept as concentrating your strength in a position where it becomes superior to the enemy몭s, and then annihilating the enemy forces. And if you몭re starting a business, the way to set yourself up in a position where you can몭t lose is to gradually build up your trade knowledge and your resources before starting operations. If you rush into it without taking the time to understand even the basics, your only hope will be to get lucky, win big, and become another of history몭s 몬famous generals.몭 It몭s like trying to win the lottery.
Here몭s an example of the right way of doing it: You graduate from university, choose a field of work, and hunker down for the next fifteen years, applying yourself to both working and learning. After fifteen years, you몭ll be a senior figure in your field, an expert. If you make it to this point, you몭ve made good on Sun Tzu몭s fabled dictate to 몬establish oneself in a position where defeat is impossible.몭 As an expert, you also enjoy certain freedoms 멪 the freedom to confidently ask your boss for a raise, the freedom to move on to greener pastures in the knowledge that plenty of people will want you on their team, and the freedom to start your own business knowing that you have the resources you need. This is a real-life example of 몬looking for a fight when you몭ve already won.몭
But who wants to wait for fifteen years? Why not just go for it! When young people set out to start a business, they don몭t really understand or have any familiarity with a given industry, so they generally opt for projects that seem the most attractive. This is an example of 몬looking for victory once you몭re already in a fight.몭 When it doesn몭t work out, they try something else, and then something else, and so on. If you몭ve tried out more than a handful of trades, you end up not belonging to any of them, and you find yourself at the fringes of a society that you몭ve never had any strong connections to.
But, then again, what about the countless successful business 몬heroes몭 cheering you on in the news media? How did they make it?
First, they haven몭t necessarily made it. Some of them are just boasting without anything to back it up. 
Second, there aren몭t actually 몬countless몭 business success stories. They are very much countable, and you can be sure that the few people who actually make it will end up in the media. If everyone were successful, it wouldn몭t be worth reporting. There are 300 million young people in China, and the ones who can claim success in business have all been 몬discovered몭 by the press. And the fact is that at least half of these 몬successful몭 entrepreneurs are actually unsuccessful entrepreneurs who know how to talk themselves up.
One passage from Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War comes to mind here: 몮The clever fighter몭s victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.몯 When someone settles into their line of work, and chips diligently away at it for the next decade or more, until their hard work bears fruit, it doesn몭t necessarily make for a captivating story. Headlines are reserved for stories like: 몬Female college grad opens sex shop.몭
There몭s a western saying that goes, 몬Successful people laugh in private, while failures occupy the pages of newspapers.몭 Don몭t be the main character of a great tragedy. Don몭t try to be like the people in the business press 멪 they몭re the preserve of low-probability events. Instead, learn from the people around you. You몭ll get a much better picture of what the world is really like.
What kinds of people are capable of being winners? Sun Tzu said: 몮The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.몯
This is about politics and discipline. In terms of politics, the people must adore you, and in terms of discipline, you must refrain from causing the slightest bit of harm. There몭s nothing deceptive to be found here.



The eternal fundamental

To talk about 몬Winning first, fighting later,몭 we have to look at 몬winning몭 and 몬fighting몭 separately. They몭re two different stages. Winning comes first, and it represents the fundamentals, the essential groundwork. Only fight once you몭ve laid the foundation. Our problem is that we몭ve always paid much more attention to fighting than to winning. We몭re fascinated by shortcuts and workarounds, and so we want to get involved in fights before winning, which inevitably means the odds will not be in your favor.

Extract from the original text:
몮The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success. In respect of military method, we have firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Numbers; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances. A victorious army, as opposed to a routed one, is as a pound몭s weight placed in the scale against a single grain. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. This is formation.몯

Analysis:
몮The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline.몯
Li Quan interprets this passage like this: 몮Be smooth in the way that you deal with contrariness. Do not attack states that have committed no wrong. When your army arrives, do not plunder, do not cut down the people몭s trees or pollute their wells. When you pass through the enemy몭s territory, you must cleanse the land of local gods and shrines and root them out; do not become habituated to the things that remain of defeated states: this is what is referred to as 몬the moral law, method and discipline.몭 You must control your army strictly and solemnly, establish the death penalty but ensure that nobody commits crimes that would warrant it to be carried out; use rewards and punishments to establish trust and righteousness. If a general can establish himself in this way, he will be able to defeat his enemy몭s failing ways of governance.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮The moral law is righteousness; method and discipline are the system of laws. He who is skillful in war first concentrates on cultivating righteousness and upholding the system of laws, for this is a way of governance that makes one immune to defeat. Wait until the enemy shows some weakness that you can use to gain victory, and then attack. This will bring you victory.몯
So, the idea is that the 몬victorious way of governance몭 is to cultivate the moral law and uphold method and discipline. The 몬moral law몭 is about whether the reason for which you몭ve gone to war is a righteous one, and 몬method and discipline몭 are about keeping a strict and clear set of military laws, while not bringing any harm to the common people. A good example of these principles is the 1928 military doctrine, Three Rules for Discipline and Eights Points for Attention, published by Mao Zedong and written for the soldiers of the Red Army. The whole text is as follows:
몮Every member of the Revolutionary Army must commit to memory the following three rules for discipline and eight points for attention:

The Three Rules for Discipline are as follows:

(1) Obey orders in all your actions. We can only win if we coordinate every step we take.
(2) Don't take a single needle or piece of thread from the masses. Then, the masses will love and support us.
(3) Turn in everything captured. Strive to lighten the people몭s burden.

We must implement the three rules for discipline, and must not forget the eight points for attention.
@	The Eight Points for Attention are as follows: 
(1) Speak politely. Respect the masses; do not act arrogantly.
(2) Pay fairly for what you buy, and give fair prices for what you sell. It is forbidden to bully or use force in any transactions.
(3) Return everything you borrow. Make sure not to lose anything you borrow.
(4) Pay for anything you damage. You must pay the full price, and not a penny less.
(5) Don't hit or swear at people. Resolutely overcome the warlords몭 ways of behaving.
(6) Don't damage crops. While marching and fighting, always pay attention.
(7) Don't take liberties with women. Resolutely root out immoral habits.
(8) Don't ill-treat captives. It is forbidden to hit or swear at them, and to take their money.
Everyone must consciously uphold discipline and never violate it, and everyone must monitor one another.
You must clearly memorize each of the points of revolutionary discipline, and the people몭s warriors must love the people in every way.
Defend the motherland and move eternally forward, and the people of the whole country will love and support us.

몮In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Numbers; fourthly, Comparison; fifthly, Victory. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.몯
The ideas of 몬measurement,몭 몬estimation of quantity,몭 몬number,몭 and 몬comparison몭 are all variables to be calculated when comparing your strength to your enemy몭s, as laid out in Chapter One, Calculations.
Du Mu comments: 몮몬Measurement몭 means 몬calculation.몭 It is about measuring the size of my state몭s territory, the number of households it contains, the amount of tax revenue collected, the number of war chariots, the ease or difficulty with which the terrain may be traversed, whether the roads are straight or winding. You must measure all of these as they apply to you, and then measure the enemy몭s situation. Only then should you raise an army.몯
So, 몬measurements몭 give us 몬estimation of quantities.몭 Once we몭ve made these estimations, we have the 몬numbers,몭 and in turn, once you몭ve measured the size of your state몭s territory, the number of households, and the amount of food produced, you calculate how many troops you can feed, how long you can support a war effort, and also how the enemy matches up to you on these points.
몬Numbers몭 give us 몬comparisons,몭 which means we have the information necessary to compare our situation to the enemy몭s.
몬Comparisons몭 give us 몬victory몭멪 once the comparisons have been made, you know who will win and who will lose. Better odds for victory go to whoever몭s numbers are bigger.

몮A victorious army, as opposed to a routed one, is as a pound몭s weight against a single grain.몯

In the original Chinese text, two ancient units of measurement were used in this passage: the yi and the zhu. One yi is equivalent to 480 zhu. Accordingly, 480:1 are not good odds. 

몮The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. This is formation.몯

In battle, a winner directs his forces as if unleashing a high mountain lake from behind a dam. Who could stand in his way? While 1,000 fathoms is unimaginably deep, he knows exactly how deep it is, though nobody else does. This is the way to approach military formations: hiding out of sight, 몬in the most secret recesses of the earth.몭
When the moment comes for him to unleash the floodwaters, he launches himself from 몬topmost heaven,몭 and his troops몭 formation becomes as water, going where the enemy least expects, avoiding where the enemy is strong and attacking where he is weak. Thus, he is unstoppable.
Sun Tzu chose to use the end of Formations to talk once again about the fundamentals: the strength of your nation, sound governance, and laws that are strict and clear.
At the start of this book, we talked about how Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War and The Thirty-Six Stratagems are two very different texts, representing two very different value systems. The Thirty-Six Stratagems is all about deception, ingenuity and sneaky shortcuts. Sun Tzu also talks about deception, but it isn몭t an important part of his work. From start to finish, he emphasizes these things above all else: the fundamentals, and actual strength.
Success always comes from long-term accumulation, not clever tricks, and successful people are always working on the most fundamental things. No matter what stage they몭re at, they몭re always focusing on the fundamentals. We몭ve talked about how 몬winning first, fighting later몭 is at the heart of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, and we몭ve discussed how winning and fighting need to be separated and understood as two different stages. Winning comes first, and winning is nothing other than working on the fundamentals. Fighting comes later, and this is the time for trying out a few sneaky ideas.
We generally run into problems when our focus is always on fighting, and not winning; when we want to use some clever idea to win quickly. Because we think like this, we get into fights without making sure to win first, which in turn leads to fighting against bad odds.



Appendix: Complete text of Chapter Four: Formations

Sun Tzu said: 몮The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself. Thus, the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy. Hence the saying: One may know how to obtain victory without being able to achieve it. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking displays a superabundance of strength. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven. Thus, on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the whole Empire says, 몬Well done!몭 To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning easy battles. Hence, his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.  Hence, the skillful fighter puts himself into a position that makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success[bd14]. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Numbers; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances. A victorious army, as opposed to a routed one, is as a pound몭s weight placed in the scale against a single grain. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. This is formation.몯



Chapter Five: Use of energy

Organizational Structure and Command Systems: The Eternal Homework Assignment

This is a part of the art of war that nobody enjoys hearing about. And yet, these dull, nap-inducing topics contain the most important secrets, which can reveal whether or not your war is winnable. Don몭t go looking for these secrets in more exciting topics 멪 they몭re not there.

Extract from the original text:
몮The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers. Fighting with a large army under your command is no different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.몯

Analysis:
Energy is powerful. Once it builds, it can몭t be stopped. The key is to create energy that will inevitably bring the results you want. Cao Cao puts it like this: 몮Using military force is about exploiting energy. If you want to use military force, you must rely on energy.
What relation is there between formation and energy? We mentioned this already 멪 before acting, you look at formations; once you몭ve taken action, you rely on energy.
몬Formation몭 is your material strength, and it몭s also your strategy. Energy is different; you can몭t give it a simple label like 몬battle tactics몭 or 몬execution.몭 One often-quoted explanation comes from the Han dynasty scholar-official, Xun Yue:
몮There are three essentials in the art of establishing policies and obtaining victory: 1) Formation; 2) Energy; 3) Circumstances. In general, formation is about calculations of what may be gained and what may be lost. Energy is about that which is appropriate in the moment-to-moment situation of a battle, and it is about opportunities for advancing and retreating. Circumstances are about whether or not, in truth, one몭s will is within the realm of possibility. Thus, the fact that results differ even when policies and events are the same is because of differences in the use of these three arts.몯
While this is an accurate analysis, Xun Yue is talking about a different kind of 몬energy몭 than that described in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War. Xun Yue understands 몬energy몭 as being about responding to events as they develop, following whatever direction offers advantage. For Sun Tzu, 몬energy몭 is something artificial, something that people can create, like a kind of 몬momentum.몭
Once you몭ve built this momentum, you exploit it, using its artificial force to propel your team forward, or even to call upon the forces of nature to do your bidding. The main point that Sun Tzu emphasizes is building momentum as a way to influence people mentally, to exert force on their will. This is why, in The Art of War, the idea of 몬circumstances몭멪 which Xun Yue separates from 몬formation몭 and 몬force몭  멪 falls under the broader category of 몬energy.몭 So, if you build the right kind of momentum, it doesn몭t matter what the circumstances are. Even if the people you몭re trying to influence don몭t have the will to do what you want, once you apply force to them, one way or another they몭ll have to do what you want! An example of this is Han Xin몭s Battle of Jingxing, when he made his soldiers fight with their backs to a river, putting them in a position where they had only two choices: fight with everything they had, or die. They had to get a grip on themselves, and fight for their lives, and that몭s exactly what they did.
Using modern language to talk about 몬energy몭 as Sun Tzu thought of it, we몭d have to use two concepts: 1) Battle tactics; 2) Management.

몮The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers. Fighting with a large army under your command is no different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.몯

Managing a lot of people is the same managing only a few, because of this idea of 몬dividing up their numbers,몭 also known as 몬staffing structure.몭 Here, 몬dividing몭 refers to squads, platoons, companies, divisions, armies, etc. The key question is: how exactly do you divide your men? Here, the idea of 몬numbers몭 is about how many men you allocate to each unit within your staffing structure. If you get your staffing and organizational structure right, it makes no difference whether you have a lot of people to manage, or a few 멪 using your human resources becomes as simple as using your own hand.
The entire discipline of modern management studies originally developed out of military management. There몭s an obscenely huge amount of scholarship and learning contained within these two small words: 몬dividing numbers.몭 A great number of companies put a huge amount of work every day into developing and better understanding their organizational structure, without ever really gaining the understanding they몭re working so hard for. Also, the faster a company몭s business develops or changes, the more reforms are needed to fine-tune its organizational structure.
So, the first passage in Energy is really about management problems 멪 specifically, organizational structure.
몬Dividing numbers몭 and 몬signs and signals몭 are fundamentally interlinked with the fifth of the 몬Five Factors몭 from Chapter One.  It says this: 몮By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.몯 Cao Cao comments: 몮몬The marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions몭 is the organizing of units, and it is also the organizing of flags and pennants, and of drums.몯 Here, 몬the organizing of units몭 corresponds with 몬dividing numbers,몭 and 몬flags, pennants and drums몭 corresponds with 몬signs and signals.몭
In ancient Chinese armies, the smallest fighting unit was called a wu, and contained five soldiers. The ancient word wu has become part of modern Chinese words, such as: duiwu, meaning 몬a squad,몭 and 몬ru dui,몭 meaning 몬to join the military.몭 Twenty wu 멪 100 soldiers 멪 makes a zu, which is more or less the same as a 몬company몭 in the modern military. Five zu 멪 500 soldiers 멪 makes a lu, and 25 lu 멪 12,500 soldiers 멪 makes a jun. 
In ancient China, all military staffing units were multiples of five. In the 20th century, Chinese Communist Party General Lin Biao invented his 몬three three몭s system,몭 making three the smallest military unit instead of five, and changing all the larger units into multiples of three. Lin Biao named the smallest unit a small battle group. Three small battle groups made up a battle squad, three battle squads made up a war platoon, three war platoons made up a company, three companies made up a battalion, three battalions made up a regiment, and three regiments made up a division. Lin Biao몭s 몬three three몭s system몭 was his own, unique invention, different from both the American regimental system and the former Soviet Union몭s division-based system.
What does it look like when an army based on multiples of three fights a battle? The officers choose experienced soldiers to lead each small battle group, and as they approach the enemy, the three members of the small battle group fan out in a triangular formation. This is to avoid clumping together and giving the enemy a chance to wipe out the entire small battle group in a single burst. So, how far apart do the three soldiers fan out? They had to stay within shouting distance of the group leader; otherwise the leader wouldn몭t be able to give his men commands.
Lin Biao would start his tactical planning at the level of the smallest, three-man unit, and extend this planning all the way up to the level of the entire Fourth Field Army. This is the meaning of 몬dividing their numbers,몭 and of the dictate that 몬Fighting with a large army under your command is no different from fighting with a small one.몭 Lin Biao was able to command the Fourth Field Army as easily and nimbly as a three-man small battle group.

몮Fighting with a large army under your command is no different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.몯

What is the key to being able to command a large army on the battlefield in the same way as a much smaller force? It몭s all about 몬signs and signals.몭 And what are these? Cao Cao explains: 몮몬Signs몭 refers to flags; 몬signals몭 refers to drums.몯 The point is that 몬signs and signals몭 are about how commands are communicated. 몬Signs몭 are like road signs, in the sense that they몭re visual commands. In addition to flags, fire and smoke beacons (sometimes fueled with wolf dung, which created particularly dense smoke) were also used. Meanwhile, 몬signals몭 were audible commands. The Han dynasty dictionary, Shuowen Jiezi, explains that the word used for 몬signal몭 in the original Chinese text 멪 ming, which means 몬name몭멪 comes from a different character that is also pronounced ming, meaning 몬night.몭 At night, it몭s hard to see, and it몭s not easy to identify someone walking toward you. So, you shout out: 몬Who goes there?몭 In response, the other person would shout their name. The idea is that names are made to be shouted, not written down on paper. And so, the meaning stretches to cover the audible commands and code words used by armies at night.
There are command signals that are meant to be seen, such as fire and smoke signals, signal flags, etc. And there are also commands that are meant to be heard, such as verbal orders to charge, shouted directives to assemble, drums signaling to advance, gongs to signal retreat, and so on. We could talk about the informatization of modern militaries, but in reality, ever since armies existed they have relied on informatization to fight wars. Famous commanders from around the world have always been information experts 멪 for example, Napoleon was a master at using flag signals. During Japan몭s century-long Sengoku period of civil wars, Lord Takeda Shingen was hailed as a hero because he designed Japan몭s most advanced and most concentrated 몬smart beacon fire system.몭 His beacons radiated out from his base in Kai Province, and used several different colors of smoke to keep him informed with up-to-the-minute intelligence. If anything happened, he could mobilize his army within minutes. Takeda Shingen didn몭t just use 몬signs몭 on the battlefield; he built them into the infrastructure. 
Organizational structure and command systems are a never-ending homework assignment for any organization, because structures always need to keep up with the relentless forward march of time. Once a company develops to a new stage, its old structure no longer works. That몭s why it몭s important for organizations to be constantly reformed and tweaked, and to have cross-departmental coordination. On the biggest scale, the national scale, the reason China몭s government has set up so many 몬leading groups몭 is to deal with problems with organizational structure and command systems. Then there are counties that are directly managed by provincial governments, which has been a much talked-about topic for years now. This is about the problem of 몬dividing numbers.몭 On a much smaller scale, in private businesses, should staff be divided into different departments according to function, or would it be better to take a multi-divisional approach? Where should the boundaries be set for each level몭s scope of authority? Who should be in charge of whom? If you have a functional department set-up, should you use localized management or vertical management? These questions are all discussed in The Art of War, but nobody enjoys hearing about them. And yet, these dull, nap-inducing topics contain the most important secrets, which can tell you whether or not your war is winnable. Don몭t go looking for these secrets in more exciting topics; they몭re not there.




The most misunderstood passage in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: 몬The regular may be used for joining battle, but the irregular will be needed in order to secure victory몭

Extract from the original text:
몮To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy몭s attack and remain unshaken 멪 this is effected by maneuvers regular and irregular. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg 멪 this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.
몮In all fighting, the regular may be used for joining battle, but the irregular will be needed in order to secure victory. Irregular tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard. There are not more than five primary colors, yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen. There are not more than five cardinal tastes, yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack: the regular and the irregular. Yet, these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers. The regular and the irregular lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle 멪 you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?몯

Analysis:
몮The regular may be used for joining battle, but the irregular will be needed in order to secure victory.몯 This passage has the distinction of being the most misunderstood line in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War.
The biggest misunderstanding, at least for Chinese people, comes from the fact that the Chinese character for 몬indirect몭멯_[bd15]^has another, much more common meaning: 몬rare몭 or 몬remarkable.몭 The meaning that is used here, which is pronounced with a different tone, is 몬odd number,몭 as in, the opposite of an even number. In the ancient Chinese language, it also meant 몬Whatever is left over after some quantity has been counted.몭 This also applies to the arrangement of troops in an army: there몭s always a main force made up of regular troops, and whatever men are left over would be referred to as the 몬irregular troops.몭 The irregular troops would be kept back from the main battle, to be used only at the crucial moment. Put simply, they were the reserves of ancient Chinese armies. 
Cao Cao comments: 몮The 몬regular몭 refers to those who are ordered to join battle first, the 몬irregular몭 to those who are ordered to join later.몯 The relation between 몬regular몭 and 몬irregular몭 is simply their sequential timing: one comes after the other. The idea is to not play all your cards at once, but to keep some in your hand so you몭ll be able to make a play when the crucial moment arrives.
When two armies face off on the battlefield, the regular troops get the fight started, and the two opposing commanders watch from the back, waiting until they see a sign that the crucial moment is at hand. Then, they throw their reserves 멪 their irregular troops 멪 into the fray, in a bid to seal their win. Even though it몭s technically incorrect, there is a modern Chinese idiom that comes from this principle, meaning 몬to win by a surprise move몭 (벶_뻝`[bd16]). This is based on a misreading; it should be 몬irregular,몭 not 몬surprise,몭 but it몭s too late to correct that now!
Sun Tzu wasn몭t the first person to come up with the idea of fighting the main battle with regular troops and winning with irregular troops. Armies had been fighting in this way for 1,000 years before he was born. The earliest record we have of it is a text about the art of war, attributed to the legendary Yellow Emperor of early antiquity, titled, Writings on Grasping the Irregular or Grasping Contingency. This text is mentioned in Questions and Replies between Emperor Taizong of Tang and Duke Li of Wei, with Emperor Taizong and Duke Li discussing what its correct title really is. Duke Li was of the opinion that it should be, Writings on Grasping the Irregular, because the pronunciation of 몬irregular몭 (ji) is exactly the same as 몬contingency.몭 Duke Li argued that there was a mix-up at some stage in the process of copying the text and passing it down, equivalent to a typo. Actually, it would be just as correct to call it Grasping Contingency, because an army몭s reserve forces are used as a contingency measure. 

몮Irregular tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more.몯

In reality, there is only a piddling number of different moves to be made. There몭s only a handful of 몬the irregular몭 멪 they몭re really a fixed quantity, used in a fixed sequence of moves. And yet, once you actually put them into play, suddenly hundreds of variations and changes jump out, as if from thin air!
It몭s just like there are only five notes in the ancient Chinese pentatonic scale (gong, shang, jue, zhi and yu), and yet the musical combinations are infinite. It몭s a similar story with the tonal scale used in modern music, which only has seven notes (do, re, mi, fa, so, la and ti), and yet can be used to sing every song in the world. Similarly, there are only five primary colors in the Chinese system (blue, yellow, red, white and black), but the hues they can produce are endless. Today, we know that there are actually even fewer 멪 only three primary colors, (red, yellow and blue) 멪 but they can be used to create all the colors that have ever existed. 
There are no more than five basic tastes (sour, spicy, salt, sweet and bitter), and yet a lifetime wouldn몭t be enough to taste all of the delectable combinations that can be created with just these five flavors. The dizzying number of different world cuisines is testament to that!
So, even though in war there are only two different forces, or forms of energy 멪 regular and irregular 멪 the variations and combinations are inexhaustible. The regular and the irregular are able to transform each other, and their interactions are like a circle, without beginning and without end.
Li Quan comments: 몮The forces that directly engage the enemy are the 몬regulars,몭 while the forces who attack from the flanks are the 몬irregulars.몭 What Li Quan is describing here is how regular and irregular troops are arranged on the battlefield, but he몭s actually only talking about how a battle actually shapes up, and that things don몭t always go to plan. If the two armies몭 regular troops engage each other, and both sides keep their shape as the fight wears on, a general might order his irregular troops to attack the enemy몭s flank. If the flank attack successfully breaks up the enemy몭s lines, the regular troops can press forward. In this situation, the smaller force used to attack the enemy몭s flank is actually playing the role of regular troops, and the original 몬regulars몭 become the irregular troops. So, Cao Cao몭s comment is more accurate than Li Quan몭s. The simplest way of explaining it is that the difference between regular and irregular troops is just a difference of timing. If you take Li Quan몭s approach and lock yourself into a rigid binary, you can몭t have any of the transformations that happen when the regular and the irregular interact.

몮In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack: the regular and the irregular; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers. The regular and the irregular lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle 멪 you never come to an end.몯

How exactly do the regular and irregular transform each other? It몭s actually very simple. In a battle, the forces you몭ve already committed to the fight are your regular troops, while the forces you keep in reserve are your irregular troops. And then, when you order your reserves to attack, they become your regular troops. When forces that are in the thick of the action pull back, they once again become your irregular troops.
So, irregular troops are just reserves that haven몭t yet joined the fight.
What historical examples are there of these principles? Some writers like to talk about the story of the Tang dynasty General Li Su몭s surprise attack against Cai Prefecture on one snowy night. In the middle of a snowstorm, Li Su led a 몬stealth force몭 in a direct attack on his enemy몭s base, capturing the renegade Tang General Wu Yuanji.
People love to hear stories like this, where the hero wins the day by perfectly executing a bold surprise attack. Nothing몭s more satisfying than when a cunning plan comes together! People expect to hear these stories, yet in real life, 3,000 years of history have only yielded a handful of examples where something like this actually happened. These stories run counter to Sun Tzu몭s value system, and they몭re based on a misunderstanding 멪 the mistaken notion that 몬using the irregular to seal victory몭 means that you몭re supposed to use surprise attacks. Impatient minds impulsively look for ingenious, fast solutions. If you몭re looking for a military theory that actually applies to Li Su몭s snowy surprise attack, a more suitable one would be the Russian Deep Battle and Operation Paralysis theories, where the aim is to attack deeply, moving past the enemy몭s defensive lines and directly striking their logistical hubs, thereby paralyzing them. 
There are three especially common misunderstandings of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War. The first, which we몭ve already discussed in Chapter One, Calculations, is confusing the meaning of 몬calculation몭 with 몬cunning stratagems.몭 It몭s a mistake that comes from the fact that the original Chinese character contains both of these meanings. The Art of War is not about 몬The Way of Deception.몭 The second misunderstanding comes from the line, 몮If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.몯 People always want to understand their opponent, and don몭t realize that their biggest problem is that they don몭t know themselves. The third misunderstanding is the one we몭ve just been discussing: people tend to be hungry for artful methods and fast results. Hence, the emphasis on surprise attacks.
But what Sun Tzu is really talking about when he says, 몮Use the irregular methods to obtain victory,몯 isn몭t surprise attacks, although there is an element of surprise to it. He몭s talking about types of troop deployment 멪 ways to effectively divide your forces.



How are battles fought? For many battles, the key to understanding is taking a look through the lens of 몬regular몭 and 몬irregular몭 forces

Extract from the original text:
몮In all fighting, the regular may be used for joining battle, but the irregular will be needed in order to secure victory.

Analysis:
In war, there are only two kinds of forces: main forces and auxiliary forces. In the simplest terms, this is about troop division, and about coordinating regular and irregular troops on the battlefield. But, the concepts of 몬regular몭 and 몬irregular몭 are fluid 멪 they interact dynamically with each other, able to switch roles at any time. Don몭t lump all of your forces into a single group, and don몭t play all of your cards in one move. Before you go to war, assign your troops to regular and auxiliary units, and coordinate the different parts of your forces so that they work in tandem. When the day of battle arrives, don몭t order your entire army to advance right off the bat. It몭s essential to keep one card in your hand; to have a reserve force. The first to go into battle are the main forces, while the irregular troops are saved for later, when the opportunity to seal victory presents itself. This is the real meaning of the Chinese idiom 몬to win by a surprise (more correctly, irregular) move.몭
Now, we몭re going to take another look at the story of General Han Xin winning a battle with his back to the river, but this time from the perspective of 몬the regular and the irregular.몭
In this battle, Han Xin led a comparatively tiny force of 10,000 troops to victory at Jingxing against a Zhao army that boasted 200,000 men. Before the battle, and while Han Xin was still leading his army along a narrow mountain road to Jingxing Pass, the Zhao strategist Lord Guangwu advised his commander-in-chief, Chen Yu, to divide his army. Lord Guangwu reasoned that the mountain road to Jingxing pass was so narrow and long that if Chen Yu only gave him 30,000 troops, he몭d be able to set an ambush on the road. And then, when Han Xin reached Jingxing, Chen Yu could set up a defensive position and refuse to engage, so Han Xin would be trapped. With his road of retreat cut off, and unable to resupply his army with food, he몭d be starved into submission within ten days. Lord Guangwu promised that if Chen Yu took his advice, it would only be a matter of time until Han Xin몭s head was delivered to him on a platter.
Chen Yu refused to listen. 몮I have nothing to fear from Han Xin! I have righteousness on my side, and a host of 200,000 men! I have no use for these deceitful schemes. Let him come, and then we몭ll fight!몯
Han Xin몭s intelligence agents reported Chen Yu몭s plan, and once Han Xin found out that his opponent had no interest in using Lord Guangwu몭s guaranteed-to-work scheme, he knew it was safe for him to advance along the mountain road. After the battle, Han Xin met with Lord Guangwu, and said: 몮If your lord had the sense to use your scheme, I would now be your prisoner.몯 But Han Xin was just being polite; he never would have allowed himself to be taken prisoner, because if the Zhao army had decided to use Lord Guangwu몭s plan, he wouldn몭t have come. He either would have devised a different route to victory, or decided to wait and bide his time, in honor of the principle: 몬Win first, fight later.몭 If you몭re not going to win, you shouldn몭t start a fight. Yet, his intelligence told him that Guangwu몭s plan wouldn몭t be used, so he made his move.
We know that Chen Yu didn몭t divide his forces, but did Han Xin? In fact, he did. When he몭d marched within 30 li of Jingxing Pass under the cover of night, he put together an auxiliary unit of 2,000 men and divided up different tasks.
At first light the next morning, Han Xin몭s army emerged from Jingxing Pass and arranged a force of 10,000 soldiers with their backs to the river. When the Zhao troops saw this, they laughed loudly. They몭d never seen an army lined up like this before, and it seemed obvious that they몭d be able to force their enemy into the water with a single charge. The Han troops were also aware of this possibility, and knew that, with their backs to the river and no way out, their only option was to fight to the death. This story is actually the origin of another modern Chinese idiom: 몬To fight with one몭s back to the water.몭
Han Xin had already dispatched his auxiliary forces the night before. Once his 10,000-strong main force was in position by the river, he personally led his ceremonial guard of honor out of Jingxing Pass, and set up his battle flags, drums and ceremonial weapons with much pageantry and bravado. Then, he began his performance.
We can see now that Han Xin actually divided his army into three elements: the 2,000-strong auxiliary unit he몭d dispatched the previous night; the 10,000-strong main unit now lined up by the river; and a separate unit under his personal command (the history books don몭t tell us how many men were in this unit). Now, let몭s look at the historical reality of which unit was which, in terms of 몬the regular and the irregular,몭 how they switched roles and how the battle was fought.
The Zhao army watched as Han Xin performed his pageantry act. They saw red. Success was dangling temptingly in front of them, and they knew that the quickest way to get the job done was to capture the enemy leader. So, they opened their gates and surged forth, and Han Xin몭s personal unit met their challenge head-on. The battle had begun.
At this stage, Han Xin몭s army was divided into one main force (the first to fight) and two auxiliary forces. The first part of his army to start fighting was the unit under his command, so this was the main force. The two other units 멪 one with their backs to the river, and the other hiding in some undisclosed location, having set out the night before 멪 were the two auxiliary forces.
What about the Zhao army? Was it also split into different forces? No 멪 at least, not before the battle started. Chen Yu had opted not to send a force to block Jingxing Pass, and instead massed his whole army inside his camp. But if you ask the question again, once the battle몭s started, then yes, it absolutely was divided! The part of the army that charged out from the camp became the 몬main force,몭 while the reserves that stayed behind became the 몬auxiliary force.몭 For Han Xin, the next move would be to manipulate the Zhao army into committing all of its forces to the fight, emptying the Zhao camp.
Meanwhile, a great battle was being fought between Han Xin몭s main-force unit and the Zhao army, and as it dragged on, the Zhao army몭s numerical superiority was beginning to show. Han Xin몭s men could no longer hold them back, so they began to retreat. It was not a dignified retreat; the battle flags, drums and ceremonial weapons were left scattered on the ground. But, this was actually designed to draw the enemy into attacking. Han Xin retreated back to his 10,000-strong riverside unit, which he then led in a frenzied counter-attack, knowing full well that this was to be a fight to the death.
At this stage, Han Xin몭s army was no longer configured as two auxiliary forces and one regular, but had morphed into one main force and one irregular. His personal unit had merged with the force stationed by the river, becoming the new main force. The 2,000 men who몭d snuck out of camp the night before had yet to appear, and were now waiting for the crucial moment when victory would be theirs to secure.
Han Xin now had a good chance of winning. Why was that the case? The key was in the battle flags, drums and ceremonial weapons his men had dropped on the ground in the chaos of retreating. When the Zhao troops saw this happen, they reacted in two different ways. First, they thought that victory was already theirs; they concluded that Han Xin몭s army was crumbling before their eyes and had been forced back to the river. One more push, they thought, and their enemies would be fish food. Second, Han Xin몭s ceremonial props represented the spoils of war 멪 the men who captured these items would be lavished with praise and glory, and this whetted the Zhao troops몭 appetite to be part of this moment and be recognized as heroes. They thought that victory was at hand, and that now was the time to call upon their auxiliary forces and win the day. So, the Zhao forces that had been kept back in camp were sprung into action.
The Zhao army no longer had an auxiliary force; they몭d put all their cards on the table. But it was not so for Han Xin; he still had one card left to play! This was exactly the moment he몭d been waiting for. He now had a chance to win, so it was time to call on his 2,000 remaining men, who were laying in ambush nearby. As they charged toward the empty Zhao camp, each carried a red Han flag. They had one mission: to tear down the Zhao flag, and replace it with the Han flag.
In this final stage, what kind of interchange was there between Han Xin몭s regular and auxiliary forces? The 2,000 irregular troops became the main force, because they were now on the offensive, while the part of Han Xin몭s army that was not on the offensive became the auxiliary force. With his main force attacking the enemy camp, the Zhao began to fall back, defeated. Actually, they weren몭t defeated quite yet, but they were already mentally defeated, and so they began to pull back. Once this was happening, they really were defeated. Meanwhile, the main force now held the enemy camp, and their task was to not allow the retreating enemy troops back in.
At this point, Han Xin몭s troops by the river switched roles and became his auxiliary force. The Zhao army realized something was wrong at their camp: they saw that it was full of red, their opponent몭s color. It had been lost to the enemy, and now they had to take it back and get back to their general. Meanwhile, a deafening racket of drums assaulted their ears from behind. Han Xin몭s forces were in hot pursuit, and now the Zhao army became trapped between their pursuers and the closed gate of their own camp. They몭d lost the will to fight, and the whole army collapsed. In the end, Han Xin destroyed a 200,000-strong enemy force, killed Chen Yu and captured the Zhao king.
In this battle, we몭ve seen how the concepts of 몬the regular and the irregular몭 are used. Han Xin was able to maintain separate regular and auxiliary forces through the whole battle, while the Zhao army ended up without an auxiliary force. If the Zhao leaders had kept 2,000 men in camp as reserves, Han Xin몭s 2,000-strong auxiliary force wouldn몭t have been able to get past them. But the sight of Han Xin몭s ceremonial weapons strewn on the ground was the Zhao irregulars몭 undoing. They thought that the battle was already over, and if they didn몭t hurry up and get involved in the action, they wouldn몭t get a share of the glory.


몮In all fighting, the regular may be used for joining battle, but the irregular will be needed in order to secure victory. Irregular tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams멞 In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack: the regular and the irregular; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers. The regular and the irregular lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle 멪 you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?몯

So, Han Xin was one of those people with the ability to 몮efficiently apply 몬the irregular몭 in ways as inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, and as unending as the flow of rivers and streams.몯 The principles of 몬the regular and the irregular몭 are infinite; they spawn each other, and shape-shift seamlessly into each other in an endless loop, bound by no beginning and no end!
Once you understand these principles, you can understand the mechanics behind a huge number of historical battles, and you can understand how they were actually fought. Of course, having this insight isn몭t the same as actually being able to put the principles into action. Still, it does enable you to at least crack the door open and get a little inside look at the game. 



Soccer as a metaphor for understanding how 몬the regular and the irregular몭 are used: the player with the ball is the main force; the player getting in position to receive the ball is the auxiliary force

When the ball is passed, there is a transformation; the player receiving the ball becomes the main force, while the player who passed it becomes the auxiliary force. The soccer field is a battlefield by another name. In fact, everywhere is a battlefield, and every minute, every second, there is constant transformation between the regular and the irregular. The changes between the regular and the irregular truly are endless.

Extract from the original text:
몮To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy몭s attack and remain unshaken 멪 this is effected by maneuvers regular and irregular. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg 멪 this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.
몮In all fighting, the regular may be used for joining battle, but the irregular will be needed in order to secure victory. Irregular tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard. There are not more than five primary colors, yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever be seen. There are not more than five cardinal tastes, yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack: the regular and the irregular; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers. The regular and the irregular lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle 멪 you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?몯

Analysis:
Let몭s go a bit deeper and break down the shifts between regular and irregular in Han Xin몭s victory against Zhao. Before the battle started, Han Xin had set up his army in one main force and two auxiliary forces. He personally commanded the main force, with one of the two auxiliary forces lined up with their backs to the river, and the other, consisting of 2,000 cavalry, laying in ambush.
As the battle unfolded, Han Xin몭s army switched three times between regular and irregular.
The first switch happened when the original main force feigned retreat, moving toward the auxiliary unit positioned by the river and merging with it. The newly combined Han force then engaged the enemy, making it the new main force.
The second switch was when the Zhao forces attacked with all the troops they had, emptying their camp in the process. Then, Han Xin몭s auxiliary force of 2,000 cavalry charged into the deserted enemy camp and switched the flags, effectively becoming the new main force. Shortly after, the enemy gave up the fight with the Han men by the river, turned back and tried to retake their camp. At this point, the large riverside force under Han Xin몭s personal command suddenly switched roles and became the auxiliary force. In other words, they were no longer part of the main battle. All of this constitutes one switch between main and auxiliary.
The third switch happened when the enemy troops were falling back in a panic, their chain of command having fallen apart. For Han Xin, the moment to seize victory had arrived. He mobilized what was now his auxiliary force and pounced on the retreating enemy, finally sealing his victory.
So, now we can see that the main and auxiliary forces aren몭t drawn up neatly and settled ahead of time. Instead, they몭re subject to change at any moment as they cycle through an infinite loop, always complementing one another.
Han Xin몭s great victory has served as an example of how an army is divided up into main and auxiliary forces, but these concepts don몭t only apply on the level of entire armies. There are also main and auxiliary forces at play on a much smaller level, like between individual squads and companies. In fact, every unit involved in a battle is wrapped up in 몬the regular and the irregular.몭 From a micro perspective, 몬the regular and the irregular몭 are the building blocks of battle tactics. They몭re why armies don몭t swarm forward like a hive of angry, disorganized bees, but instead work in regimented coordination, operating according to strict timing. This is the real reason why Sun Tzu said that the changes between 몬the regular and the irregular몭 are truly infinite: you could never run out of new combinations.
몬The regular and the irregular몭 are not only used by large armies. When Xiang Yu found himself making his last stand at the River Wu, with only 28 cavalry troops still by his side, he didn몭t charge the enemy in a single mass. He only had 28 men, but he still split them into two groups 멪 one main and one auxiliary 멪 that fought in tandem. In war, 몬the regular and the irregular몭 is truly a fundamental principle.
We can get a good understanding of how 몬the regular and the irregular몭 are used by looking at a soccer match as an example. Whichever player has possession of the ball is 몬the main force,몭 and any player who몭s making a run without the ball, in an effort to get in a good position, is an 몬auxiliary force.몭 Whenever the ball is passed, the roles switch. Whoever receives the ball becomes the main force, while the player who has just passed becomes an auxiliary force. If 몬the main force몭 attacks up the sideline and sees a gap in the opposition midfield, there몭s a chance to seize victory. The 몬main force몭 kicks the ball into the penalty box, passing the baton to their teammate, who receives the ball and, taking the opposition by surprise, attacks where they are unprotected. This unleashes the auxiliary in the same moment that they switch roles and become the 몬main force.몭 They shoot for victory, and the ball goes in the back of the net! 
The soccer pitch is no different than a battlefield. In fact, as we몭ve said, everywhere is a battlefield, and 몬the regular and the irregular몭 are everywhere, switching back and forth constantly, every second of the day. 

몮The regular and the irregular lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle 멪 you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?몯

So, when we study battle tactics, it몭s as if we몭re studying soccer. In soccer, don몭t make the mistake of believing that 몬winning by surprise몭 means that if you make a fancy, surprise move, you몭re guaranteed to win. In reality, there몭s no such thing as a 몬surprise move.몭 There are only a handful of 몬moves몭 out there, and everyone already knows them. The problem is that nobody has the ability to actually use them. All soccer formations basically come under the umbrella of 5-3-2, 4-3-3, 4-4-2, the 몬bus몭 (9-0-1), and, if you몭re losing and angry about it, 1-0-9멞 and if you몭re losing and angry about it and only have 30 seconds left in the game, 0-0-10. In battles, tactics basically boil down to either a balance between attacking and defending, or deploying in a flank-center-flank formation. But these are not what몭s most important. What몭s really crucial is how strong the coach몭s leadership abilities are, his strategic thinking abilities and tactical acumen, and the players몭 physical conditioning, skills, experience, training and cleverness. If you don몭t get these basics right, how is a 몬surprise move몭 going to help you win?
There are only 11 players in a soccer team, but the 몬regular and irregular몭 remain infinitely variable. After all, Xiang Yu divided his troops into main and auxiliary forces even when he only had 28 men left. Small and big armies alike divide into main and auxiliary forces, unless they want to lose. Even an army of a million soldiers can lose if it몭s not divided properly.
Now, let몭s look at one more example from Chinese military history: The Battle of Fei River.
The Emperor of Former Qin, Fu Jian, marching at the head of a massive army of 800,000 to attack the state of Jin, lined his troops up in battle formation by Fei River. Meanwhile, his enemy, the Jin commander, Xie Xuan, had only 80,000 men. Xie Xuan sent a messenger to Fu Jian, to tell him to line his troops up by the river and make a little space by moving back, and that Xie Xuan would then cross the river with his army so they could get the fighting started. This way, they could get it over with as quickly as possible.
Fu Jian agreed to Xie Xuan몭s request, and ordered the front part of his army to move back. But the rear part of his army didn몭t know what was going on; they thought their comrades up front had been beaten, so they panicked and began to run away. Xie Xuan crossed the river, and delivered a crippling blow to the already limp Former Qin army.
Where did Fu Jian go wrong?
People generally attribute Fu Jian몭s error up to colossal stupidity on his part. What sane person would listen when their enemy tells them to retreat?
But in reality, of course, Fu Jian wasn몭t that stupid. He몭d made his own calculations, and he몭d talked things through with his brother and advisor, Fu Rong. His plan was to pretend to agree to Xie Xuan몭s request, back up a little, and let him cross the river. But, instead of waiting for Xie Xuan몭s men to safely cross, he was going to send in his armored horsemen to attack while only half of their forces had crossed. He wanted to wipe them out before they ever got a chance to reach the far shore.
On the face of it, this is a textbook strategy, completely watertight.
So, what went wrong? Fu Jian몭s mistake was that he didn몭t split up his army into main and auxiliary forces. Retreating wouldn몭t have been a problem if he had left an auxiliary force in the wings. Then, if anything went wrong with the main force, or if Xie Xuan somehow made it to the shore and went on the attack, the auxiliary force would be able to deal him a direct hit, and he wouldn몭t have had any advantage.
But Fu Jian was far too careless. He didn몭t really take Xie Xuan seriously. He thought that it몭d be enough to just back up a little, get Xie Xuan to cross the water as quickly as possible, trap him in the middle of the river and finish him. He didn몭t see any need to set up main and auxiliary forces.
On the other hand, Xie Xuan did have an auxiliary force, led by Zhu Xu, who had originally been an Eastern Jin general and had fought against the Former Qin. But he lost a battle, was captured, and formally surrendered to Fu Jian. Fu Jian then put him to work in his own army, making him a Former Qin general. This was the main reason behind Fu Jian몭s eventual doom. It was in his nature not to be suspicious of the people working for him, and even if he did have suspicions about a person, he몭d still put them to work for him. Half of those he몭d put in charge of his troops were like Zhu Xu: people with very different intentions than his own.
Before the Battle of Fei River, Fu Jian sent Zhu Xu to try to persuade the Eastern Jin leader Xie Shi to surrender. This was Zhu Xu몭s big chance. When he met with Xie Shi, he told him that although it was claimed that the Former Qin army numbered 800,000 men, not all of them had yet been assembled. If the Eastern Jin forces attacked quickly and routed the Former Qin vanguard, they몭d have a chance to defeat Fu Jian. It was because of this information from Zhu Xu that Xie Shi and Xie Xuan decided to make their move so quickly.
When Fu Jian waved the flag signaling for his men to retreat, the units in the rear didn몭t know what was happening. This was the result of the work done by Xie Xuan몭s 몬auxiliary force,몭 Zhu Xu. The clever Zhu Xu had loudly shouted: 몮The Qin army is defeated! We몭re finished!몯 At this point, the battle hadn몭t even started, but when the Qin soldiers saw the men in front of them falling back, and heard people behind them shouting that they몭d been beaten, they panicked and ran for their lives. The Jin army crossed the river. Fu Rong jumped on his horse and galloped over to the retreating Qin forces, trying to stop them, but luck wasn몭t on his side. His horse tripped, and he was flung to the ground and killed by Jin soldiers. Then, the Qin army really did collapse.
So it goes with the changes between the 몬regular and the irregular.몭
There몭s one more line in this passage that we haven몭t looked at yet: 몮That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg this 멪 is effected by the science of weak points and strong.몯 The next chapter in Sun-Tzu몭s The Art of War is dedicated to 몬Weakness and Strength,몭 so we몭ll pick this thread up again later.



Simplify your movements before you act; action should be a rapid release

Extract from the original text:
몮The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon, which enables it to strike and destroy its victim. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.몯

Analysis:
Swiftly flowing rivers can wash away boulders, because they harness the energy of water. Birds of prey can fly and dive with incredible speed and ferocity, because they have mastered timing with relation to both the moment of action and distance. In the same way, when people who have mastered the use of armed force to win wars attack, they do so with speed and ferocity. When the time comes to act, their movements come in short, sudden bursts. An army at its most lethal is like a crossbow wound tight and quivering under enormous tension. A military force몭s quick, sudden action is like pulling the trigger.
The key part of this passage is: 몮The good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision.몯 There are two concepts here, and the most important one to grasp is the latter: 몬being prompt in decision.몭 In this instance, 몬prompt몭 doesn몭t only mean being quick about doing something, but also minimizing the distance that has to be crossed when you act.
Another way of interpreting 몬being terrible in onset몭 is the idea of maximizing potential energy, and then rapidly releasing that energy over the shortest time and distance possible. This is how to deliver a high-precision strike on your target while also maximizing your attack몭s deadly force. 
More than any of the other commentaries on this passage, Li Quan몭s cuts straight to the essence: 몮When one fires an arrow, if your shot lacks force and speed, then the arrow will not travel far. If you shoot it over a great distance, you will not hit your target.몯
Despite the stories we may have heard as children, it몭s simply not true that the best bowmen reach mastery of their craft by splitting sticks in two from 100 paces! The principles of the art of war tell you not to set your sights on achieving such impressive feats. Instead, you몭re advised to shoot at a wicker basket from ten paces 멪 then, you몭re guaranteed to both hit your target and do so with enough force to pierce it. Another excellent analogy comes from the animal kingdom: When mother cheetahs teach their cubs how to hunt antelopes, the cubs learn that they can몭t start their chase from 100 paces. Instead, they learn to silently slink their way to within 50 paces of their target, before exploding into motion out of the cover of the high grass. The most important lesson is that they have to hit their prey immediately. If they don몭t, and the antelope starts running, there몭s no guarantee they몭ll be able to catch it.
Now is a good time to look back at a line from earlier on in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: 몮What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning easy battles. Hence, his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit for courage.몯 It몭s the same principle with bowmen: true masters aren몭t renowned for being able to skewer tiny targets from a great distance. Rather, the way they work is by sneaking up right under their targets몭 noses, and then shooting from point-blank range. People who aren몭t in the know might say that there몭s nothing difficult about that. These are the same people who say of a famous modern-day Chinese entrepreneur, 몬So what if Shi Yuzhu ran 300 million-yuan advertisements for his 몬brain platinum몭 product? That doesn몭t mean he몭s good at what he does! If you gave me 300 million-yuan ad spots, I몭d do a much better job!몭 The question they forget to ask is: 몬How did he get those 300 million-yuan ad spots?몭 Do people think they just fell from the sky, straight into his hands? Anyway, even if you were given those spots, would you actually know what to do with them?
몬Being terrible in onset몭 and 몬Being prompt in decisions몭 are fundamental principles, to be incorporated whenever we design any kind of work project. That몭s because, even if you plan ahead as though your life depends on it, and no matter how meticulous you몭ve been, when the time comes to act, things generally aren몭t that simple. Very rarely are ideas as effective in execution as you imagined during the planning stage. The worst-case scenario is, if you몭re working on a one-year plan, for example, sitting through a two-hour meeting, and at the end you still haven몭t gotten through everything you need to discuss. So, you decide to 몬leave it for now.몭 If you keep on 몬leaving it,몭 then just as an orchestra falls to pieces if a single musician doesn몭t show up, something is sure to go wrong later on, when you몭re trying to fit together different pieces of a complicated plan.
The right way to do it is to be like the bowman who winds his crossbow tight, sneaks up under his victim몭s nose and looses a single, deadly shot.
In war, you should win with a single battle; when firing a bow, you should hit your target with a single shot. Your preparation work is all about focusing on how to deliver that single blow, storing up the energy you몭ll need to strike, sharpening your single arrowhead, and choosing the time and place for your strike. It몭s not about shooting a lot of arrows; don몭t be sloppy. If you prepare properly 멪 and are 몬terrible in onset몭 and 몬prompt in decisions몭 멪 you몭re guaranteed to hit your target. On top of that, you몭ll only need one arrow. If you do decide to take the other, sloppier route 멪 assembling a whole bunch of bowmen to shoot a whole bunch of arrows 멪 not only will you not hit your target, but each of those men and each of those arrows will need to be paid for, both in money and energy.
This principle is a thread that weaves through the whole text of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War.



Courage and fear aren몭t about individual people; they몭re about energy

Extract from the original text:
몮Amid the turbulence and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your soldiers move in circles, yet they cannot be defeated. Disorder comes from order, fear comes from courage; weakness comes from strength. Order or disorder? This is a question of subdivision. Courage or fearfulness? This is a question of latent energy. Strength or weakness? This is a question of tactical dispositions. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it. By holding out baits, he moves him where he wills; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.몯

Analysis:
몮Amid the turbulence and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your soldiers move in circles, yet they cannot be defeated.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮The banners swirl chaotically, but this is to give the appearance of disorder to the enemy; then, drums and gongs unify the army. The war chariots and cavalry move in circular formation, and their movements are patterned and ordered.몯 What Cao Cao is talking about here is manipulating the enemy, making them think that you몭re unorganized, weak and fearful. But, in reality, you몭re well ordered, strong and brave.
몬Turbulence몭 refers to a specific image 멪 battle flags flying around chaotically, never staying in place. 몬Tumult몭 refers to soldiers moving back and forth, apparently at random, while in reality they몭re bound together by tight discipline and a clear awareness of their duties, each with their own assigned role, able to be disruptive while being immune to disruption.
There몭s another layer of meaning beneath the surface of Cao Cao몭s words: 몮The banners swirl chaotically, but this is to give the appearance of disorder to the enemy; then, drums and gongs unify the army.몯 The banners swirling around in chaos are just a show put on for the benefit of the enemy commander standing far away. Meanwhile, drums and gongs quietly serve as the army몭s actual system for communicating commands, safely out of earshot of the enemy.
Wang Xi comments: 몮The commander desires inner clarity and outer darkness; inner control and outer chaos. So, he performs a show for the enemy, so that he might be underestimated.몯 In brief, the name of the game is tricking the enemy.
몮Amid confusion and chaos, your soldiers move in circles, yet they cannot be defeated.몯 Here, we몭re talking about troop deployment.
Du You explains in his commentary that the original word that몭s been translated as 몬confusion몭 actually refers to the turning of chariot wheels, while 몬chaos몭 refers to the pounding of galloping horses몭 hooves. 몮His troops move freely and unhindered, deployed in a circular pattern rather than a rectangular one, each troop with its own role.몯 
How can a circular formation make an army unbeatable? Du Mu cites an explanation offered by the ancient text, Writings on Grasping the Irregular, also known as The Yellow Emperor몭s Art of War. 몮Four parts constitute the main, four parts the auxiliary, and the surplus shall be the 몬fist.몭 First, send out a mobile battle unit to set the edges.몯
Expanding on this, Du Mu wrote: 몮The army consists of nine parts: the ninth part, the surplus, stays within the general몭s grasp and does not move. Thus, the general maintains all other units.몯 
This means that if an army has nine parts, four parts make up the main force that몭s used to launch the first attack; another four parts make up the auxiliary force that forms the army몭s reserves and is deployed at the vital moment in order to seal victory; and the left-over ninth part is known as the 몬fist.몭 This is the part that stays in a fixed position with the general, tightly within his grasp.
In a later part of The Art of War, Sun Tzu talks about being as 몬immovable as a mountain몭 멪 the commander-in-chief cannot move. If he moves forward, it몭s because the battle has already been won and the fighting is over. If he moves backward, it몭s because his army has suffered a total collapse. So, even if your enemy몭s troops cut their way through to your position, you can몭t move. That kind of situation is what the 몬fist몭 unit is for; it몭s there to keep enemy troops away from the commander. If the commander moves even slightly, or if his flag falls, his army몭s morale will evaporate and his men will run for their lives.
Of course, there are some situations where running away is necessary.
몮First, send out a mobile battle unit to set the edges.몯 This means that when organizing and deploying your battle units, you need to deploy one to clearly demarcate where each of the others is to be deployed. The mobile unit does this by taking each unit몭s unique flag and planting it in the right position. Then, the personnel of each unit assemble by their unit몭s flag.
몮Four parts constitute the main, four parts the auxiliary.몯 This line is a reference to the legendary 몬stone sentinel maze.몭 Contrary to popular belief, the stone sentinel maze wasn몭t invented by Zhuge Liang, but was in fact much earlier 멪 4,500 years ago, by the Yellow Emperor and his general, Feng Hou. It is also known as Feng Hou몭s Eight Formation Diagram. Similarly, Writings on Grasping the Irregular is also known as Feng Hou몭s Writings on Grasping the Irregular. Sun Tzu몭s philosophy and insights represent a continuation of Feng Hou몭s work, as do Zhuge Liang몭s version of the stone sentinel maze. Even the Tang dynasty Emperor Taizong몭s ambitious work of drama, Music of Prince Qin Breaking through the Enemy Array, was based on Feng Hou몭s Eight Formation Diagram.

몮Disorder comes from order, fear comes from courage; weakness comes from strength.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮These forms all convey destruction, but conceal the true situation.몯 So, disorder, fear and weakness are all just a pretense, a show put on for the enemy몭s benefit, and a way of hiding the real condition of your army.
Show the enemy disorder where in reality there is order; show fear where there is courage, and weakness where there is strength. The reason why 몬disorder comes from order몭 is that you must manage your army with both transparency and tight discipline if you몭re going to have any chance of effectively producing an illusion of chaos on the surface while still maintaining perfect order. The reason why 몬fear comes from courage몭 is that it takes extraordinary courage to act scared enough to suck the enemy in. Finally, the reason why 몬weakness comes from strength몭 is that you need your army to be exceptionally strong before you can feel confident enough to make a show of weakness and lure the enemy into launching an all-out attack on you.
The above forms the logic for the next passage: 몮Order or disorder? This is a question of subdivision. Courage or fearfulness? This is a question of latent energy. Strength or weakness? This is a question of tactical dispositions.몯
We몭ve already talked about the idea of 몬subdivision,몭 which appeared in the first line of Energy: 몮The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.몯 The idea is that an organization몭s structure is built by properly dividing human resources into well-ordered units.
What determines whether your men feel scared or brave? Basically, the answer is energy. It몭s about knowing how to draw a group of people around you and inspire them to fight. But, if you take a group of people to war who haven몭t gone through military training, how do you make them brave? Bravery comes when you put them in a place of deadly peril 멪 a place where, if they don몭t fight, they몭ll die. When people are put in this situation, they instantly turn into death-defying berserkers. That몭s exactly what Han Xin did when he put his troops in a position where they had to fight with their backs to a river. So, bravery or lack of bravery really isn몭t about people몭s personalities; it몭s about the broader idea of 몬energy.몭
Strength and weakness are about how you present yourself. When Liu Bang sent an envoy to the Xiongnu Chieftain, the shrewd Modun made sure the envoy only saw the old and weak of his camp, the sick and disabled, men and horses both. Liu Bang fell for Modun몭s trick, and as a result his 300,000-strong expeditionary force was surrounded at Baideng, and Liu Bang very nearly didn몭t make it back home.
The passage몭s final couple of lines give a summary: 몮Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something that the enemy may snatch at it. By holding out baits, he moves him where he wills; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.몯
So, commanders who are skilled at manipulating their foes are able to move them exactly where they want them, no matter what impression of their own forces they engineer and present to the enemy. If they give the enemy a little incentive, the enemy is bound to come after it. Then, once the enemy has been lured in, they unleash their true military strength and meet the enemy with force.








To appoint the right people, use three energies: Qi (Air) energy, Earth energy and Adaptive energy

Extract from the original text:
몮The clever combatant looks to the effect of energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize energy. When he utilizes energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill; but if round-shaped, to go rolling down. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. This is energy.몯

Analysis:
몮The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined energy.몯
According to a common saying, the energy of a situation is a much stronger force than individual people. The balance between victory and defeat lies in how energy is created. This is a question for commanders-in-chief to ponder, not something that can be passed off to subordinates. If something isn몭t done right, you can몭t just blame the people below you, or claim that the problem is that they didn몭t carry out the plan as they were supposed to. You can몭t pressure subordinates to get things done by themselves, because the real problem is that you didn몭t do a good enough job laying the groundwork. Even if the people working for you aren몭t up to scratch, that몭s still your problem, because you didn몭t choose the right people.
This is why exceptional leaders focus on energy, and don몭t blame the people working for them. They have the ability to create the right energy, and to choose the right personnel.
Du Mu comments: 몮Skilled commanders first weigh the energy of their army, then weigh the ability of their men and assign appointments according to their strengths and weaknesses. They do not flagellate subordinates by attacking their personal lack of worthiness.몯
It몭s essentially about using the right people in the right places. If the wrong people are used in the wrong places, the only person at fault is the leader.
A good example of these principles is the story of Cao Cao몭s 몬stratagem in a sealed envelope.몭
When Cao Cao led an army to Hanzhong to fight against Zhang Yu, he left three commanders 멪 Zhang Liao, Li Dian and Le Jin 멪 behind to guard the city of Hefei with a garrison force of a little over 7,000 men. Just before Cao Cao left, he gave a sealed letter to Military Protector Xue Ti, with instructions to open it in the event of an enemy attack.
Not long after Cao Cao몭s departure, the Eastern Wu Emperor, Sun Quan, marched toward Hefei at the head of a 100,000-strong invasion force. Cao Cao몭s four generals took out the letter and tore it open. It read: 몮If Sun Quan comes, Generals Zhang and Li are to lead men out into the field to fight him. General Le is to remain in Hefei and guard the city, and the Military Protector also must not go out to fight.몯 Three of the generals were perplexed, but Zhang Liao understood what Cao Cao meant, and explained: 몮Prime Minister Cao is away fighting. If we wait for him to come to our aid, our city will lie in ruins long before he arrives. Prime Minister Cao is telling us to take advantage of the fact that Sun Quan몭s military energy is not yet fully established. We must make a quick, brief strike so as to cut away his aura of power. Then, we shall be able to successfully defend the city. If we get this right, everything will go well. But if we don몭t, the only outcome for us will be defeat.몯
There was no delay. Li Dian and Zhang Liao, both of whom were ferocious warriors, attacked Sun Quan before his forces had a chance to get settled. Sure enough, they inflicted a shocking defeat on the Wu Emperor. The Wu army had been banking on its aura of power, but now that was gone. When Zhang and Li returned to the city, the garrison was in high spirits and feeling very secure in their position. Sun Quan had been slapped in the face, and although he re-gathered his forces and attacked the city, after ten days he still hadn몭t made any gains. So, he decided to withdraw.
The historian Sun Sheng commented: 몮War is 몬The Way of Deception.몭 Hefei was successfully defended by a stranded army, with no reinforcements coming to their aid. If the city had been left in the hands of lion-hearted warriors, their fondness for fighting would have led to disaster. On the other hand, if the defense had been left entirely to cowards, then their fear would have made it difficult to stand firm. But because the enemy몭s soldiers were far more numerous than the defenders몭, the enemy was bound to be vulnerable to apathy. So, fearless commanders were sent out to strike the ill-prepared enemy, and their powerful energy ensured that they would win. First winning a victory and then returning to the defensive is a sure way to stand strong against attack! Hence, the reason why Cao Cao chose commanders with diverse temperaments 멪 because this enabled his forces to respond to a changing situation, and ultimately everything proceeded as he had so presciently calculated.몯
During the reign of the Tang dynasty Emperor Taizong, his advisor and high-ranking general, Duke Li, stated that armies have three energies: qi (air) energy; earth energy; and adaptive[bd17] energy.
Qi energy is, above all, about personal inner power. When you have it, other people will believe that you are powerful.
Duke Li said: 몮The general pours scorn upon the enemy, the troops delight in fighting, one몭s aspirations tower up into the sky, and one몭s qi becomes as powerful as a whirlwind; this is what is meant by qi energy.몯 Duke Li is saying that you should strategically show contempt for your enemy, while still taking him very seriously in terms of planning the details of battle tactics. If you do this, he asserts, you will create a powerful aura, and this aura will turn into true power, as real as a raging mountain river.
We have all experienced, whether in our work or in negotiations, the crucial importance of qi energy. It is the essence of authority. If a person immediately backs away three yards when they first see you, you have a three-yard advantage before you몭ve even started. We sometimes see celebrities leveraging their star status to get away with acting in outrageous ways, and people let them get away with it because they feel they have to submit to celebrities몭 qi energy. Mark Twain몭s short story, The Million Pound Bank Note, is about how possessing a million-pound note enables you to eat, drink and live for free. This, too, is qi energy at work.
Qi energy isn몭t all empty air. It몭s very real, and that몭s because it몭s actually the product of accumulated strength. You can몭t effectively pretend to be strong when you몭re not. For example, the reason Twain몭s million-pound bank note had such power was because it was real. It could never have had the same effect if it was fake. Every successful figure has a sense of how their own qi energy changes as their success grows. It truly isn몭t an empty notion 멪 the more social recognition you get, the stronger your qi energy grows; everything starts to go your way, and you become virtually invincible.
Qi power requires a solid foundation of actual, real strength. This is vital. Next, it requires other people to be convinced that you have it; they have to be overwhelmed by your qi power. Otherwise, you몭ll have to fight them head-to-head.
Moving on, what is 몬earth energy?몭 Duke Li writes: 몮A small path through a narrow mountain pass, so narrow that a single soldier could hold it against a thousand, stopping them from passing. This is 몬earth energy.몭몯 Hence the Chinese saying used to describe the most ideal circumstances possible: 몬When the Heavenly timing is good, when the land is favourable, and when the people are in harmony.몭 In that way, 몬earth energy몭 is about controlling all of the best terrain 멪 having this advantage is like holding all the aces in a game of cards. No matter how talented your opponent is, they just won몭t be able to compete with you. So, how do you make sure the aces end up in your hand? You have to take them before anyone else realizes how valuable they are. The land, or 몬earth,몭 that you want has always been there, waiting, just like the aces have always been waiting in the deck of cards. They belong to whoever claims them. The key is to know which cards are the aces. A good example is when Zhuge Liang lost control of the Jieting region. Jieting was an ace card; it embodied 몬earth energy.몭 Whoever held Jieting also possessed earth energy. Without it, their earth energy dissipates.
Once Zhuge Liang lost his earth energy, no amount of fighting would do him any good. Retreat was his only option.
The third type of energy is 몬adaptive energy.몭 This is about adapting to the enemy몭s situation and energy, and taking advantage of the situation in front of you. Duke Li writes: 몮Adaptive energy is when the enemy is lax, when his soldiers are hungry and thirsty, his vanguard forces have not yet made camp, and when his rear forces are halfway through a river crossing.몯 We몭ve already talked about the story of Cao Cao몭s 몬stratagem in a sealed envelope.몭 This plan worked because he knew that Sun Quan commanded massive numerical superiority, and that there was a potential advantage for him in this. When a large army on the march reaches its destination, the natural thing for its commander to do is to wait until all of his troops are fully assembled and settled before launching an attack. This is exactly the situation Sun Quan was in: his 몬vanguard forces had not yet made camp몭 and 몬his rear forces were halfway through a river crossing.몭 Cao Cao knew how to take advantage of the situation. His forces delivered a stinging blow straight to Sun Quan몭s face, immediately puncturing his opponent몭s momentum, deflating his aura of power, and at the same time strengthening their own aura. So, adaptive energy is about being fluid and finding gaps to exploit; it몭s about opening and closing, manipulating the enemy, and being prepared to strike hard whenever the enemy몭s changing situation allows.

몮When he utilizes energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.몯

Cao Cao comments that 몬utilizing energy몭 is about 몬utilizing natural energy몭 멪 moving with the natural flow. To do this, you first have to shape and design the 몭natural conditions.몭 This means putting the right people in the right places. If you can do that, everything will go your way, organically and naturally.
Think of people as logs and stones: heir shapes and natures are unchanging, so if you put them in a place of safety, they will be safe. If you put them in a place of danger, they will be in danger and unable to get out of danger몭s way, because they are inert and cannot move under their own power.
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Logs and stones are heavy objects, but though it is difficult to shift them with force, it is easy to move them with energy.몯 If you try to move a tree trunk or a boulder just using brute force, you몭ll find you can몭t make them budge even an inch. However, if you place them on top of a mountain, then by using the mountain몭s energy rather than muscle-power, a light nudge can send them crashing down with incredible power.
What about armies? 몮No matter how large an army is, it can fight through the use of energy, but it cannot be maneuvered using brute force. This is The Way of Nature.몯
When Han Xin led his force of 10,000 against an enemy army numbering 200,000, every single one of his troops fought like untethered wild men. They did so because Han Xin exploited energy rather than putting responsibility on his men몭s shoulders. That energy came from the fact that the only way out of fighting was to jump into a watery grave at the bottom of a river. The troops몭 only option was to fight for their lives.
In the Battle of Fei River, Fu Jian commanded a truly colossal army against his enemy몭s 80,000. Yet, despite having a policy of executing runaways, he was powerless to stop his troops from fleeing the battlefield. This is because the circumstantial energy was different: his men had an escape route available to them, and they took it. As for the officers, who were supposed to be executing the runaways, they had their hands full dealing with the onslaught of enemy troops.
There몭s a reason why when generals surround a city in a siege, they often leave one side open so that the enemy troops have somewhere to run. It몭s about managing the energy, and making sure that you don몭t put the enemy in a position where they have to fight for their lives. It몭s much easier to annihilate an enemy army if you can force them to run for their lives and attack them as they flee. This way, you can also avoid fighting a costly battle in which you might lose 800 of your own men for every 1,000 enemy soldiers you kill. To really put the cherry on the cake, you can position an irregular force somewhere along the enemy몭s escape route, ready to ambush them as they flee.

몮Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. This is energy.몯

Sun Tzu finishes off his fifth chapter, Energy, with a short conclusion. He summarizes the meaning of energy: when a round stone is rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height, who can stand in its way?
몬Potential energy몭 is a term we몭ve all come across in physics class. It몭s expressed in the formula mgh (mass x acceleration due to gravity x height).
The potential energy of a round stone on top of a mountain is equivalent to its weight multiplied by the height of the mountain. When the stone begins to roll down the mountainside, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is calculated with the formula 1/2mv2  (the square of mass x speed/2).
The higher the mountain, the faster the speed of the stone. Nobody can stop it once it몭s rolling.
Du Mu comments: 몮A stone rolling down a high mountain cannot be stopped; this is not because of the stone, but because of the mountain. When soldiers have the courage to win a hundred battles, the question of whether they are strong or weak is not decided by themselves, but by energy.몯  Basically, it몭s all about where you position things. 
In Wang Xi몭s commentary, he writes that stones are incapable of rolling by themselves; what makes them unstoppable is the energy of the mountain. Similarly, in war you can몭t force victory, because military energy is not something that can be strong-armed into existence.
So, what makes a skillful leader is their ability to exploit energy, not people. Once they몭ve exploited energy, then they appoint the right people to the right positions.


Appendix: Complete text of Energy

Su Tzu said: 몮The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers. Fighting with a large army under your command is no different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy몭s attack and remain unshaken 멪 this is affected by maneuvers regular and irregular. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg 멪 this is effected by the science of weak points and strong. In all fighting, the regular may be used for joining battle, but the irregular will be needed in order to secure victory. Irregular tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return once more. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard. There are not more than five primary colors, yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen. There are not more than five cardinal tastes, yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be tasted. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack: the regular and the irregular; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers. The regular and the irregular lead on to each other in turn. It is like moving in a circle 멪 you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination? The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent, which will even roll stones along in its course. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon, which enables it to strike and destroy its victim. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger. Amid the turbulence and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your soldiers move in circles, yet they cannot be defeated. Disorder comes from order, fear comes from courage; weakness comes from strength. Order or disorder? This is a question of subdivision; Courage or fearfulness? This is a question of latent energy; Strength or weakness? This is a question of tactical dispositions. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something that the enemy may snatch at it. By holding out baits, he moves him where he wills; then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him. The clever combatant looks to the effect of energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize energy. When he utilizes energy, his fighting men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. This is energy.몯


Chapter Six: Weak points and strong

The enemy has weak and strong points, and so do you

Don몭t try to 몬fix몭 your weak points. Instead, learn how to fight as you are 멪 weaknesses, strengths and all. Learn to not try to fix all of your problems, but to keep moving forward, even in the midst of those problems. When you learn how to do this, you will have mastered the essence of 몬weak points and strong.몭

Extract from the original text:
몮Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will be exhausted.몯

Analysis:
Let몭s start by talking about what 몬weak points and strong몭 are. Du Mu comments: 몮In war, generals invariably seek to avoid the enemy몭s strong points and strike his weak points. The first thing a general must do is to decipher the weak and strong points, both of the enemy and of their own forces.몯
No matter how thoroughly you prepare your defenses, there will always be a weakness somewhere, and it will be exposed. But, this also means that the enemy has weak points, and you can find ways to expose them as well. You can even find ways to engineer new weaknesses in the enemy forces. Then, you can attack the enemy몭s weak points while steering clear of their strong points.
The last two chapters, and this one, are all about how wars are fought, and they follow a logical progression: In Formation, Sun Tzu talks about winning first and fighting later; in Energy, he talks about how armies are to be deployed and split into main and auxiliary forces, with the main force used to start battles and the auxiliary force used to win them. Now, in Weak Points and Strong, he talks about avoiding the enemy몭s strong points and striking where they몭re weak.
The point to keep in mind in this chapter is that both you and your enemy have weak and strong points. Is it possible to make yourself strong in every area; to cover all your bases and have not a single weakness?  No, that would be impossible. If you try to make yourself as strong as possible in every area, then inevitably every part of your defenses will be flawed, because there are limits to resources, and similarly there are limits to people몭s energy and concentration.
There몭s a line later on in Weak Points and Strong that reads: 몮Should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.몯 It몭s impossible to have all the good things fall into your lap, and yet people are willing to believe that that they can indeed have all the good things, because this is a highly appealing idea. 
So, we often entertain wishful thinking. A useful anecdote on this point is the Wooden Bucket Theory: the amount of water a wooden bucket can hold is determined by the length of the bucket몭s shortest stave. If we want our bucket to hold more water, we have to lengthen the shortest stave. It would be completely useless to try to lengthen the longest stave, because no matter how long it may be, the water will only go as high as the shortest stave before spilling on the ground.
To put it in Sun Tzu몭s language, your longest stave is your 몬strong point,몭 and your shortest stave is your 몬weak point.몭 Where does success come from 멪 lengthening your longest stave? No. To be successful, you have to lengthen your shortest stave. There몭s no getting around your weak points; you have to acknowledge them, and you have to acknowledge that you are not a god, but human, and that you are prone to all the traits that come as part of being human.
Then there몭s all the nonsense that we learn from a young age, ideas that would have us deny that we are actually human. In Chinese, there몭s a phrase that몭s a good example of this: 몬Have what other몭s don몭t; when others can do something, do it better than them; when others are better than you at something, do it faster than them; when others are faster than you, then transform.몭 How is this supposed to be possible? This whole idea assumes that you몭re not human but a god, while the 몬others몭 are mere mortals. And if it were actually possible to put this idea into practice, then the art of war would be irrelevant. You wouldn몭t need to learn about 몬avoiding the enemy몭s strong points and striking him where he몭s weak.몭 You could just attack whichever part of the enemy몭s몭 forces you feel like, using whichever part of your own forces you feel like, because whatever you chose to do, it would be like hitting an egg with a rock. The enemy would shatter on impact.
The idea that you can just be better than everyone else by sheer force of will is madness. In the real world of actual military strategy, there is a fundamental principle: 몬I have what the enemy doesn몭t, and what the enemy has, I don몭t.몭
When we were looking at the idea of 몬If you know the enemy and you know yourself, then you can fight a hundred battles without fear of losing,몭 we talked about how the main problem we have is that we don몭t know ourselves, and not that we don몭t know the enemy. It몭s quite easy to focus more on other people while forgetting to be mindful of ourselves. We think, 몬Of course I know myself,몭 but in fact the person we know least tends to be ourselves. Similarly with 몬weak points and strong,몭 we can몭t just focus on other people몭s weaknesses and strengths while assuming that we몭ve effectively strengthened ourselves on every front. We몭d be wrong to think that; no matter what you do, you will always have both strengths and weaknesses, and it몭s impossible to patch up all your weaknesses. If you think you몭ve patched up all your weaknesses, every one of those patches is in fact a weakness.
Don몭t try to 몬fix몭 your weak points. Instead, learn how to fight as you are멞 weaknesses, strengths and all. Learn not to try to fix all of your problems, but to keep moving forward, even while surrounded by difficulties. When you learn how to do this, you will have mastered the essence of 몬weak points and strong.몭
Sun Tzu said: 몮Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.몯
When you arrive at the battlefield before the enemy, your troops and horses will be well rested and full of energy. Not only that, you몭ll also have the pick of the best terrain, meaning that you can wait for the enemy to arrive knowing that you몭ve already secured advantageous 몬earth energy.몭 
But when you arrive after the enemy, the best terrain will already be occupied by your foe. And, you몭ll likely get no rest after your long, tiring journey, but be forced to fight immediately. You몭re making your job much harder for yourself when you arrive after the enemy.
To rephrase this idea in a more relatable context, it몭s like going on a business trip to meet a client, and then having to sit through a two-hour meeting. For the client sitting in their office waiting for you to arrive, all they need to do is set aside two hours from their day. Meanwhile, you have to catch a flight to the client몭s city, and check in and out of a hotel, and by the time you get back home, the whole process has taken two full days of your time.
Our historical example for this passage comes from the war between the Later Zhou dynasty and the Northern Qi. The Later Zhou army moved to attack, but the Northern Qi commander, Duan Shao, held a defensive position inside his city walls. There had been heavy snowfall that day, and snow lay deep on the ground. The Later Zhou commander had sent a vanguard infantry force toward the city, moving in from the west. 
Northern Qi scouts informed their commander and his generals that the enemy army was now within two li of the city. All of the generals were eager to march out and fight in the open, but Commander Duan Shao reasoned against this: 몮Infantry troops have limited energy reserves, and it몭s extremely tiring to trudge through snow as deep as there is today. If we charge out now, the snow will make it hard for us, too. The better option is to deploy our soldiers in battle formation and wait for the enemy; thus, the enemy will be exhausted but we will be fresh. Victory will surely be ours.몯 Sure enough, the Northern Qi forces crushed the Later Zhou army that day, wiping out their vanguard infantry forces and routing their rear forces.


Creating a home field advantage

Extract from the original text:
몮Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy몭s will to be imposed on him.몯

Analysis:
몬Imposing one몭s will on the enemy몭 is about making the enemy come to you. 몬Allowing the enemy몭s will to be imposed몭 on oneself means that the enemy has caused you to come to them. 몬The clever combatant몭 has the ability to manipulate the enemy, while not allowing the enemy to manipulate them.
During the Eastern Han dynasty, a general named Fei Yi, who was in the service of the rebel commander Zhang Bu, sent his younger brother, Fei Gan, to hold a defensive position in the city of Juli. A commander of the Han imperial army, Geng Yan, moved in close to Juli and made ready to attack the city. He cut down a large number of trees, and let it be known that he planned to use them to fill in the city몭s moat, after which he would attack. Several days later, Geng Yan몭s forces captured a rebel soldier, who informed them that Fei Yi had heard Geng Yan was planning to attack Juli, and was preparing to come to his younger brother몭s rescue. When Geng Yan heard this, he loudly ordered his troops to ready their weapons and prepare for battle in three days몭 time. Then, he had his guards 몬accidentally몭 let the enemy prisoner escape. The prisoner made his way to Fei Yi몭s camp, and told him about Geng Yan몭s plans. Sure enough, Fei Yi ordered his forces to move out; he was coming to rescue his brother. But Geng Yan was ready; he left 3,000 troops to keep Juli surrounded, while with the bulk of his forces he personally orchestrated an ambush against Fei Yi. Geng Yan won a crushing victory that day, and executed Fei Yi.
This is a classic strategy: besieging a city in order to manipulate the enemy into sending a relief force, and then ambushing that relief force while it몭s still on the road. 
Zhang Yu comments: 몮When I manipulate my enemy and cause him to come to me and fight, then he will always be in a position of weakness; if I do not travel to attack the enemy, then I will always be in position of strength. This is the art of using the strength and weakness of the enemy and of myself.몯 It몭s about putting yourself in a position of strength, and the enemy in a position of weakness.
Du You comments: 몮When two armies are far away from one another, they are equal in weak points and strong. The enemy may come to me and thus imperil himself, but I may not imperil myself by going to him.몯
Zeng Guofan also wrote his own, brief explanation of the idea of 몬imposing one몭s will on the enemy and not allowing the enemy몭s will to be imposed몭 on oneself. 몮It is delightful to be the host, but not at all delightful to be the visitor.몯 This is the concept of the home field advantage, exactly the same as in soccer matches. The visitors start with a 30% handicap. So, it몭s important to come up with a way to position yourself in a 몬home field몭 position, and make sure your enemy is forced to play the role of the 몬visiting team.몭


Don몭t get carried away by your emotions; the art of war can be used to do all kinds of things, but the moment you get carried away, it all goes out the window

Don몭t be greedy. Greediness in a person makes them easy to trick. Don몭t believe that some things are too important to ever let go of, because this makes you liable to being baited by your enemy. Except for your own life, everything is expendable. 

Extract from the original text:
몮By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.몯

Analysis:
What is this chapter, Weak Points and Strong, about? According to Cao Cao, it몭s about 몮the ability to navigate the strengths and weaknesses of both yourself and your enemy.몯 In other words, it tells us that both sides in a conflict have strengths and weaknesses, and that it몭s important in war to use your strong points to strike the enemy몭s weak points. To do this, you need to manipulate the enemy into moving where you want him, turning his strong points into weak points.

몮The clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy몭s will to be imposed on him.몯

Make the enemy come to you. Make them play the role of the 몬visiting team,몭 while you enjoy the advantage of playing in your 몬home field.몭 How do you go about doing this? You do it by 몬holding out advantages to him몭 멪 in other words, by finding a way to tempt him.
When General Li Mu of the state of Zhao took up his border garrison command, the first thing he did was build up his fortifications and evacuate the surrounding countryside. He closed his gates and refused to come out and fight for ten years, forcing the Xiongnu chieftain to hold his breath and wait. Finally, Li Mu chose a day to emerge from behind his walls and lay out bait for the enemy, in the form of several thousand troops sent out to 몬fight a battle몭 against the Xiongnu. When Li Mu몭s suicide force was defeated, their oxen and sheep were scattered across the countryside, and this temptation proved too much for the Xiongnu chieftain, who had been starved of plunder for ten years. Swept up in uncontrollable excitement, he forgot all about the art of war, and led his entire army out to pluck up Li Mu몭s lost livestock. Meanwhile, Li Mu had set an ambush. On that day, Li Mu wiped out 100,000 Xiongnu cavalry. The Xiongnu were so badly beaten that they didn몭t dare show their faces again for years afterward.
This is an example of 몬holding out advantages.몭 But why did the Xiongnu chieftain fall for such a simple trick? He must have just been too excited. After all, he몭d been waiting for a chance like this for ten whole years! Ten years without stealing so much as a single sheep, and without fighting a single battle! After all that time, the chieftain would have been on the verge of losing his mind. We know that people are prepared to die for a chance to get rich, just as birds are prepared to die in pursuit of their next meal. He couldn몭t help himself; he saw a prize waiting for him to grab, and he lost control of himself.

몮By inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.몯

If you don몭t want to make your enemy come to you, or if you want to move him away from the battlefield, you몭ll need to attack something that he is bound to want to protect, and inflict damage where it몭s bound to make him anxious. If you do this, the enemy몭s anxiety will cause him to lose all concern for himself, and focus entirely on protecting whatever it is he considers so precious.
A classic example of this principle from Chinese military history is a Warring States period story of how the Zhao city of Handan, under siege by a Wei army, was saved by an allied Qi army. When the Wei commander Pang Juan attacked the state of Zhao, the state of Qi sent Commander Sun Bin with an army to the rescue. But, instead of rushing to join the fray at the besieged Zhao city, Sun Bin headed directly toward the Wei capital city, Daliang, and put the city under seige. With Daliang under attack, the Wei army couldn몭t hang around at Handan; they had to pull back and relieve their capital city. And so, suddenly, the siege of Handan was broken. Sun Bin몭s next move was a textbook example of the strategy of 몬setting up a siege to destroy the relief force.몭 He devised an ambush for the returning Wei army, positioning himself in a home field advantage and forcing the Wei army into the role of the 몬visiting team.몭 He successfully made himself strong and the enemy weak, himself fresh and the enemy exhausted, and in the battle that followed the Wei army was battered. Commander Pang Juan died in the fight. 

몮If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him.몯

The point is to be in a situation where you몭re fresh and well rested, but the enemy is exhausted. If, at the starting point, both you and your enemy are well rested, you need to come up with a way to exhaust him; you need to keep him so busy that he doesn몭t have time to think. 
During the Spring and Autumn period conflict between the states of Wu and Chu, the Wu general Wu Zixu put together three separate forces, with the express intention of using them for 몬harassment missions.몭 With much fanfare, he marched out to attack Chu at the head of one of those forces, but once the entire Chu army had been mobilized to fend him off, he retreated back home to Wu. Then, he waited until the Chu army had been disbanded and sent home, and immediately moved again to attack Chu, this time at the head of the second of his forces. He kept using this tactic to harass Chu, to the point that their leaders were unable to think straight, and he managed to do this without fighting a single battle. Then, with deadly speed, he mobilized all three of his forces, and this time he attacked for real, sacking the Chu capital city. This was the first time in the Spring and Autumn period that a state had successfully attacked the capital city of another state.
This same tactic was used by the Sui dynasty to defeat the rival state of Chen. Every time that the crops were just ready for harvest in the Chen territory, the Sui dynasty leaders deployed their armies and pretended they were about to attack. Then, they waited until the state of Chen had finished frantically mobilizing its forces to face the Sui threat, before standing down. They repeated this over and over, until the people of Chen were physically and mentally spent.

몮If well supplied with food, he can starve him out.몯

This is about finding a way to use hunger against your enemy. We just spoke about how the Sui dynasty harassed its rival, the state of Chen, and in fact, hunger was also a part of the Sui strategy. The state of Chen was located south of the Yangzi River, where the climate is warm and damp, and where most of the houses are made of thatch. Food was hung up inside these houses for storage, rather than kept in the relative safety of underground cellars. So, the Sui leaders dispatched several raiding squads to roam the Chen territories and set fire to settlements, using the prevailing winds to their advantage. The people of Chen would build new houses, but then their Sui tormenters would come again and burn them down once more. This left the people with nothing 멪 starving and utterly destitute.
Years later, in the final days of the Sui dynasty, General Yuwen Huaji, who had just engineered a coup, led his army to attack another Sui general named Li Mi. But, Li Mi knew that Yuwen Huaji didn몭t have much grain, so he pretended to sue for peace, claiming that he was no match for his adversary. Yuwen Huaji was delighted, and was content to wait while preparations were made for a peace treaty to be signed. In reality, Li Mi was just playing for time, waiting for Yuwen Huaji몭s army to run out of food. Yuwen Huaji didn몭t bother rationing his supplies, because he believed he몭d soon be able to feed his men from Li Mi몭s granaries. Once his food was gone, though, he found that Li Mi suddenly wasn몭t quite as peaceful as he몭d seemed. Soldiers need to eat, and Yuwen Huaji몭s men soon went over to Li Mi몭s side, and so he lost. 

몮If quietly encamped, he can force him to move.몯

Cao Cao says: 몮Attack whatever the enemy will be compelled to protect, appear where he will compelled to meet you; this is how to force the enemy to launch a relief action.몯
When one of Cao Cao몭s generals, Sima Yi, led an expedition to Liaodong to attack a rebellious general named Gong Sunxiao, Gong Sunxiao deployed his forces along the Liao River, blocking Sima몭s way forward. Sima Yi had no intention of fighting Gong by the river, and he told his generals in a meeting: 몮Our foe몭s encampment is strong and well fortified, and it is his intention to tire us out. If we attack him here, we will be doing just as he has planned. We must attack him elsewhere, somewhere that he will be compelled to protect, so that we can force his men to leave their camp.몯
Sima Yi made a big show of strength close to the enemy, while secretly sending part of his army around the enemy몭s defenses and behind their lines to besiege Gong Sunxiao몭s base, the city of Xiangping. Gong Sunxiao was left with no choice but to leave his front-line camp and fight out in the open. Sima Yi crushed his army, executed him and restored stability to the Liaodong region.
But, if you look at this situation in terms of the results 멪 Gong Sunxiao was executed 멪 there wasn몭t actually any need for him to rescue Pingxiang. Liaodong is a land of brutally cold winters. If Gong Sunxiao had hunkered down in his fortified camp, and pulled grain and people from the surrounding countryside inside his gate, it wouldn몭t have mattered if all his cities had been burned to the ground. He could have stayed safe, far away from the cities, wait for winter to come and for Sima Yi to run out of food and pull his forces back. And then, Gong Sunxiao could have attacked him as he retreated. If he몭d done this, he would have had a chance of holding on to power in Liaodong. In fact, this is exactly how the people of Korea were able to survive for thousands of years as an independent nation without being annexed, even though it sits right at the edge of China.
So, in conclusion, don몭t get carried away. The art of war can be used to do all kinds of things, but the moment you get carried away, it all goes out of the window. Don몭t be greedy. Greediness in a person makes them easy to trick. Don몭t believe that some things are too important to ever let go of, because this makes you liable to being baited by your enemy. Except for your own life, everything is expendable.


Don몭t do things your own way without caring what people think; Do things your own way, but do it in a way that people don몭t expect; Don몭t let people know what you몭re doing

Extract from the original text:
몮Appear at points which the enemy will not be quick enough to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.몯

Analysis:
Cao Cao comments: 몮Compel the enemy to mount a relief effort.몯
We often talk about how people should walk their own paths, and not worry about what other people say. But, from the perspective of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, this is not best way to do things. Instead, he suggests, walk your own path in a way that other people would never expect, and don몭t let others know what you몭re doing.

몮An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not.몯

There are two classic examples from Chinese military history that shed light on this passage, and both come from armies that conquered the kingdom of Shu, in modern-day Sichuan Province.
One of these examples is well known in China, because a fictionalized version of it forms part of the classic novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It comes from the story of how Zhong Hui and Deng Ai conquered Shu. Deng Ai, taking advantage of the fact that the Shu commander Jiang Wei was boxed in at Sword Gate Pass by Zhong Hui, led a force east from Yinping along the Jinggu Path. He cut south through the mountains and emerging in Shu territory, over 200 li away from Sword Gate Pass. He몭d led his troops on a perilous journey through difficult terrain, building bridges and walkways along sheer cliffs as he went. For over 700 li, his forces moved in single file through uninhabited wilderness, a dangerous land of soaring peaks and deep canyons. Throughout Deng몭s journey, he had no access to food resupplies, and he often found himself in seriously dangerous situations. At one point, having arrived at a place called Horse Pavilion Mountain, he discovered that the way ahead was impassable. For a moment, it seemed he was stuck, unable to move forward or backward, but he eventually came up with a solution. He wrapped himself in felt and rolled down the mountain slope, ahead of his men. 
Finally, Deng Ai led his troops out into the Sichuan Basin, taking the enemy by surprise and making straight for the city of Jiangyou. Once there, he forced the garrison commander, Ma Miao, to surrender. Then, Deng Ai cut a bloody path all the way to the Shu capital city of Chengdu, at which point the Shu Emperor, Liu Chan, surrendered.
Our second example comes from the Northern and Southern Dynasties period (420-589 CE). The Prince of Wuling, Xiao Ji, had gained control of Sichuan (Shu), installed himself in the city of Chengdu, and declared himself Emperor. The ambitious Xiao Ji had designs to attack Emperor Yuan of Liang and seize control of the Liang territories. Meanwhile, the Northern Wei dynasty leaders saw an opportunity. The head of the Northern Wei military, Yu Wentai, thought that the time was ripe to gain control of both Shu and Liang. But, the other Northern Wei generals couldn몭t come to an agreement. So, Yu Wentai entrusted one of them, Yuchi Jiong, to take control of the mission. When Yu asked Yuchi what his plan was, he replied: 몮The lands of Shu have been isolated from the central Chinese territories for over a hundred  years. They are surrounded by dangerous mountains and rivers, so the Shu leaders will not expect me to attack. The best plan is to attack with an elite armored cavalry force, moving quickly and at night. We will travel at double speed in places where the road is easy, and when we encounter dangerous roads, we will slow our pace and advance more gradually. Thus, we will take the enemy by surprise and strike straight to his heart. He will surely be unable to defend against us if we attack in this way.몯
And that is exactly what happened. Yuchi Qiong entered Shu through Sanguan Pass, besieged Chengdu, and took the city within 50 days, enabling him to take full control of the Shu territories.

몮You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended.몯

There몭s a mantra that people often repeat: 몬Fight when there is no possible outcome other than victory; attack where there is no possible outcome other than overwhelming the enemy몭s defenses.몭 But this is impossible, because it몭s not just your slogan; your enemy will have it posted all over his walls, too. The only situation in which these words can become a reality is if the enemy hasn몭t made defensive preparations. Using soccer as an example again, it몭s no easy thing to score a goal when there are defenders in front of you, even if you몭re as talented as Argentine superstar Diego Maradona. To score, you first have to maneuver back and forth, wait until your opponent takes the foot off the gas, and then shoot.
Our next military example comes once again from Geng Yan몭s campaign to put down Zhang Bu몭s rebellion during the Eastern Han dynasty. Zhang Bu had ordered his younger brother, Zhang Lan, to hold a defensive position in the city of Xi몭an, and he sent another of his generals to defend the city of Linzi. Meanwhile, Geng Yan marched his army towards Xi몭an, and set up camp 40 li outside of the city. Studying the city몭s defenses, Geng saw that although Xi몭an몭s walls were small, they were sturdy, and manned by experienced troops under the command of Zhang Lan. Linzi, on the other hand, though protected by high city walls, would be a much easier target to attack. So, Geng Yan made up his mind to attack Linzi instead. To do this, he had to convince the enemy that he was planning to attack Xi몭an, so he used the same trick he몭d used to such good effect before. He ordered his men to build siege weapons, and let it be widely known that he was planning to attack Xi몭an. Then, he 몬accidentally몭 let some captive enemy soldiers escape, so that they would go back to their commanders with news of his fake plans. When Zhang Lan heard, he began intensive preparations to ward off Geng Yan몭s coming attack.
At midnight the day before Geng Yan had said he would attack Xi몭an, he called his officers from their beds to eat with him, and announced that they would be marching straight for Linzi. The officers didn몭t come around immediately, and argued that they should attack Xi몭an instead. But Geng Yan reasoned with them that Xi몭an had strong walls, elite soldiers and watertight defenses, whereas Linzi was undefended. Geng Yan told them that the enemy would never expect them to suddenly show up at Linzi몭s city walls; with their enemies shell-shocked, they could take the city within a single day. Then, once Linzi had fallen, Xi몭an would be within their reach. So, they몭d be killing two birds with one stone.
Geng Yan put his plan in motion, and the events that followed happened exactly as he몭d said they would. 

몮You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.몯

If you want to guarantee that you몭ll be able to hold your ground against enemy attacks, you need to prepare solid defenses even in places where the enemy is not attacking. When the enemy attacks you in the east, it몭s possible that he몭s just bluffing, and that his real attack will come from the west. So, what happens if you haven몭t set up proper defenses in your western positions? Well, something like what happened in the example above. Geng Yan wanted to capture Xi몭an, so Zhang Bu didn몭t bother properly defending Linzi, which led to Linzi falling into Geng Yan몭s hands.
Earlier on, during the Western Han dynasty (206 BCE-9 CE), there was a major uprising called the Rebellion of the Seven States. The commander of the Han imperial forces, Zhou Yafu, was holding a defensive position in the city of Changyi. The rebel army attacked swiftly, heading straight for the southeastern section of the city walls, but Zhou Yafu made sure to position a large part of his troops near the northwestern section of the walls. Before long, the rebel army did indeed send its best troops to attack from the northwest. However, because Zhou Yafu had set up strong defenses, the rebels couldn몭t break through. With the rebels forced to abandon their attack, Zhou Yafu pursued them as they retreated and inflicted a massive defeat on them.


At its most refined, 몬Weak points and strong몭 is about appearing and disappearing like a ghost, Holding your destiny and your enemy몭s destiny in the palm of your hand

Extract from the original text:
몮Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack. Oh divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy몭s fate in our hands.몯

Analysis:
몮Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.몯
Being good at attacking means making your enemy unsure where to defend, and being good at defending means making your enemy unsure where to attack.
Cao Cao gives us a very simple comment on this point: 몮It is about not leaking intelligence.몯 In other words, don몭t let the enemy know what your army is doing.
When attacking, if the enemy has no idea where you몭re going to attack, he won몭t know how to defend. He몭ll expend a lot of effort working out what you몭re doing, and then he몭ll set up defenses, only for you to feint left and strike right. In Chinese, this stratagem is known as 몬luring the tiger out of its mountain lair.몭
When defending, if the enemy can몭t work out where your weak and strong points are positioned, he will be unable to come up with an effective attack plan. He몭ll put a lot of effort into working out where the gaps in your armor are, only to fall into your ambush when he tries to attack.
This is the principle (the Dao) of 몬weak points and strong.몭 If you want to win, you need to avoid the enemy몭s strong points and strike his weak points. You need to make sure the enemy can몭t find your weak points, so that each time he thinks he몭s figured you out, and attacks, he runs straight into your strongest point, like hitting a brick wall. Meanwhile, when you attack, you need to always manipulate the enemy into exposing the gaps in his fortifications. Once you몭ve done this, burst through as quickly as possible and liquefy his entire position.
If you can do all this, you will have almost supernatural abilities.

몮Oh divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy몭s fate in our hands.몯


The Dao of 몬weak points and strong몭 truly is extraordinary. It empowers you to attack like a lightning bolt from a cloudless sky, and to defend like a mole hiding deep underground. With 몬weak points and strong,몭 you can appear and disappear at will, wrap your enemy around your finger, and put him entirely at your mercy. This is how to take control of your enemy몭s fate.
In the original Chinese text, in the sentence translated as 몮And hence we can hold the enemy몭s fate in our hands,몯 Sun Tzu says that you will be like the underworld god in charge of people몭s fates. In Waging War, the second chapter of The Art of War, he also says: 몮Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter (god in charge) of the people몭s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.몯 The general who knows his men is like a god to the people of his country, and he holds their fates in his hand; what he does will decide whether they live or die. Here, in Chapter Six, Sun Tzu takes it a step further by talking about how to become the arbiter of your enemy몭s fate, and taking control of whether your enemy lives or dies.
He Shi comments: 몮Sun Tzu is here discussing the art of weak points and strong. It is divine in its subtlety, and it has the ultimate efficacy in achieving success. With it, I can make my strong points seem weak to my enemy, and my weak points seem strong. Where the enemy is strong, I can manipulate and move him, so that he becomes weak. Where the enemy is weak, I can perceive his lack of strength. In summary, my enemy cannot see my weak and strong points, but I can see everything about his weak and strong points in a single glance.
몮When I am preparing to attack the enemy, I know where his defenses are strong and where they are inadequate and weak, so I can avoid his strong points and attack him where he is fragile. When the enemy wants to attack me, I know that when he makes a great deal of noise and fuss about attacking a certain position, that position will certainly not be his main focus; rather, the place I actually should fortify with additional troops is wherever he has not yet attacked.
몮I show the enemy my weak points, but attack him with my strong points. If he makes a show of attacking from the east, then I should prepare to defend against him in the west. So, when I want to attack him, he doesn몭t know where to defend; when I want to defend against him, he cannot find a good opening to attack.
몮The variables involved in attacking and defending stem from the art of using weak points and strong. I am either defending, in which case I am like a mole hiding deep underground, or I am attacking, in which case I am like a lightning bolt striking from a cloudless sky. I erase my tracks and thus I cannot be seen; I muffle my voice, and thus I cannot be heard. I delve into the ground and spring forth from thin air; I emerge suddenly and disappear into the space between things; I shine like the stars and move like a ghost; I enter into realms of nothingness and circle the void in the underworld. This is the subtlety of all subtleties, the divine of all divinity; the sharpest eyes in the universe cannot perceive the nuance of its forms, and the most acute ear in the universe cannot hear its divine sound. It has form yet it is as though without form; it makes sound yet it is as though soundless. It is not that it has no form, but that the enemy cannot see it; it is not that it makes no sound, but that the enemy cannot hear it. This is the immaculate intricacy of the variations in between weak points and strong.몯
This lengthy bit of commentary by He Shi basically covers all there is to say about the wondrous essence of 몬weak points and strong.몭 But is it really so 몬divine?몭 Actually, it really is! So, how is that you can avoid falling for the enemy몭s bluffs, while making the enemy fall for yours and take control of his movements into your hands? This is basically a question of experience and intuition. To put it in a philosophical frame, it몭s a question of uniting your knowledge and your actions as one, which was a major theme in the School of Mind, a movement identified with the major Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming.
In ancient Chinese military circles, everyone was very familiar with Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War and Thirty-Six Stratagems, and even a six-year-old can understand the concept of the bluff. But, once you몭re on the battlefield and your enemy is charging from the east like a thunderstorm, with dead bodies piling up before him, how do you know if he몭s actually planning to attack from the west? And what if he knows you know that he몭s bluffing? Won몭t he then just follow through on his bluff and continue his main point of attack in the east, or even change direction entirely and attack from the north and south?
Here몭s another example question: do you know that sugar is sweet? Of course, everyone knows that. But, if someone has never eaten sugar, how do you describe to them what sweetness is?
So, though every commander in ancient China would have read The Art of War, and may even have it memorized word-for-word, how much actual knowledge you have of it is a different matter entirely. When people read books, they can only learn from those books to a certain extent, determined by their own limitations. If you can몭t map the knowledge from the books onto your own life, you don몭t really know what you몭ve read. Not only that, you don몭t know that you don몭t know what you몭ve read, and you have the illusion that you know everything about it. General Zhao Kuo is a classic example. He was an armchair strategist, and not only did he not know what he was doing, he also didn몭t know that he didn몭t know. Worse than that, he thought he knew everything, and this is exactly how he brought ruin on his country.
So, can we know if our enemy is bluffing 멪 feinting to the east, only to strike from the west?
No! That몭s because knowing about the concept of the bluff doesn몭t count as having real knowledge of it. Actual understanding only happens on real battlefields. Whether he몭s bluffing in the east or in the west, it doesn몭t really matter; it몭s about being able to instantly see where the enemy몭s weak and strong points are, and understanding where you need to position yourself.
This is the meaning of unifying knowledge and action as one. If you want to learn how to unify knowledge and action, you first have to know that you don몭t know.
There몭s a Confucian saying that sages know things precisely because they don몭t know them, whereas small-minded people don몭t know things precisely because they know them. Sages know that they don몭t know things, which makes them cautious, alert and wary. They are good at observing, studying and asking questions, and so they are able to gain knowledge about things. But small-minded people don몭t know that they don몭t know, and because they think they know things, they have no ability to observe, study and ask questions. This is why they don몭t know things.
Just because we몭ve studied the art of war doesn몭t mean we몭ll be able to win real-life battles. The act of reading books and studying is a kind of self-reflection; we mould the way we study around our real-life work, and then continue to refine this knowledge and gain more understanding of it as we apply it to our real lives and seek to improve ourselves.
For the last part of our discussion on this passage, I몭m going to talk about a story from my own personal experiences.
Once, over dinner, I introduced a work partner to a good friend of mine. After we finished our dinner, my friend told me, very bluntly, that this person I몭d been working with wasn몭t up to scratch. He told me, 몮I can tell you exactly how much firepower this guy몭s working with 멪 I can literally put a number on it.몯 
I was taken aback, and asked: 몮How can you tell?몯 
몮Whenever someone has less money than me, I can tell how much money they have the moment I meet them, because I know how people act in each of the different levels of wealth. I can몭t tell when a person has more money than me, but I can always tell when someone has less.몯
This happened many years ago, but it had such an impact on me that I몭ve always remembered it. As I reflected on what my friend had said, and on my own experiences, I realized that I had a similar knack. Whenever I talk business with someone who has less money than me, I always have a clear idea of how much they have, and I can actually tell quite easily when they몭re telling the truth and when they몭re faking it. This is because whatever they몭re talking about, I have a memory-bank of similar experiences from my own life to compare it with, and I know whether what the other person몭s talking about is the real thing. Similarly, if the person I몭m talking with has more experience than me, and has seen more of the world, there몭s no way for me to know.
This is the meaning of unifying knowledge and action. It really is a mysterious thing. That몭s why Sun Tzu called it a 몬divine art of subtlety and secrecy몭 멪 this is one thing that he couldn몭t use words to communicate to us.


Retreating and pursuing are both important parts of military tactics

Extract from the original text:
몮You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy몭s weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.몯

Analysis:
If you want to attack the enemy and leave him powerless to stand in your way, you have to look for a chink in his armor during the heat of battle, and immediately burst through it. If you pull it off smoothly, you need to pull back rapidly as soon as you몭ve met your objective, circle the wagons and defend your position, so the enemy has no way to hurt you while you몭re exiting the battlefield.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Order your troops to charge the enemy where he is weak and lax. Then, retreat with speed.몯
In Cao Cao몭s own military career, he became a real-life example of his own words. In fact, he kindly left us with an example and a counter-example, both from the same battle, during his campaign against Zhang Xiu.
Cao Cao had surrounded Zhang Xiu몭s stronghold, the city of Rangcheng, when he received a message from the rear. It informed him that another of Cao Cao몭s enemies, Yuan Shao, was taking advantage of Cao Cao몭s absence to attack the city of Xudu. Cao Cao had no choice but to withdraw.
When retreating, the first thing you have to do is make your enemy confused and disoriented, and then pull your troops back as quickly as possible. When Cao Cao retreated, he split his army into a main force and an auxiliary force, and then waited for Zhang Xiu to come chase him. When Zhang Xiu saw that Cao Cao was pulling back, he coordinated with the army of his ally, Liu Biao, and attacked Cao Cao from either side, in a pincer movement. Under Cao Cao몭s expert direction, his forces delivered a crushing defeat to Liu Biao몭s and Zhang Xiu몭s two armies, and then rapidly withdrew.
Everything went exactly as Cao Cao had planned, except for one thing: he hadn몭t accounted for a certain, extremely talented adviser who was working for Zhang Xiu, a man named Jia Xu.
As the victorious Cao Cao ordered his men to retreat, an enemy force under the personal command of Zhang Xiu got ready to chase after him. But, Jia Xu had something else in mind.
몮Don몭t pursue them! If you chase after them now, you are sure to lose,몯 Jia Xu said.
But Zhang Xiu was eager for revenge, and there was no way he was going to listen to Jia Xu in that moment. He went straight after Cao Cao, who then cut him off from his reinforcements and demolished his pursuit force.
When Zhang Xiu returned home with the remnants of his defeated army, he told Jia Xu: 몮Since you seem to know when I몭m doomed to lose, do you also know when I몭m certain to win? If you only know when I몭m going to lose, then I몭ll never win. But if you do know how I can win certain victory, then tell me! That몭s the only way I몭ll be able to win!몯
Jia Xu said: 몮You need to take these troops you몭ve just come back with and go after Cao Cao. If you do this, you are sure to win!몯
This time, Zhang Xiu listened. Without even asking Jia Xu to explain his logic, he turned on his heel and went out after Cao Cao. Sure enough, he managed to break the back of Cao Cao몭s rear reserve force.
When Zhang Xiu returned, he declared Jia Xu a genius, and asked him to explain what had just happened.
Jia Xu replied: 몮Actually, it몭s a very simple concept. Cao Cao attacked us, but he didn몭t beat us. He took the decision to withdraw on his own initiative, which could only mean he had some kind of problem to deal with back in the rear that was forcing him to retreat. Since he had to retreat, he was always going to prepare properly 멪 he would lead a group of elite soldiers to cut off any enemy pursuers. My lord, you are a capable commander, but you are still somewhat behind Cao Cao. I knew that there was no way you could beat him, so I knew you were sure to lose.
몮He몭d won a big victory against us, and then he beat our pursuit force. So, in his head, everything was going as well as it could be, and he naturally would have thought that we wouldn몭t come after him again. He was preparing to concentrate all his efforts on retreating, and he was planning to go back ahead of his main army accompanied by his best generals and advisors to take care of whatever problem he had to deal with back home, while leaving the job of covering his army몭s retreat to his other generals. These generals, and the troops they led, weren몭t a match for our men, so I knew that the second time we went after him, we몭d be bound to win.몯
Retreating from a battle is an important part of military tactics. In terms of organizing a retreat, the heavy supply wagons have to go at the front, while the army몭s best fighters go at the back.
However, a certain Song dynasty commander named Bi Zaiyu came up with an extremely innovative way of retreating during a fight against Jin dynasty몭s army. His innovation is known as 몬Hanging up a goat and beating the drums.몭 He strung up a goat in his camp, and placed its two front hooves on the surface of a war drum. The goat, which was quite upset, struggled to get free, and stamped repeatedly on the drum, making a huge amount of noise. This went on day after day, and the Jin army listened as the sound of the drums from the Song camp grew gradually fainter, weaker and less frequent. This seemed odd to them, so they sent scouts over to see what was happening. Only then did they realize that the camp was deserted 멪 the Song forces had retreated several days earlier.
Pursuing a retreating enemy is also an important part of military tactics. It formed the core of Communist Party General Lin Biao몭s approach to war. His military principles included 몬One point, two sides,몭 몬Three three몭s,몭 몬Four swifts and one slow,몭 and 몬Three ferocities,몭 among others.
Earlier in the book, when we were looking at 몬dividing numbers,몭 we took a first look at Lin Biao몭s 몬Three three몭s몭 organizational system.
In his 몬One point, two sides몭 principle, 몬one point몭 is about shattering the enemy by concentrating your firepower on a single point, and attacking that point with maximum ferocity. The 몬two sides몭 are about surrounding the enemy on two sides, or more, so as to not allow him to escape. Then, you can wipe out his forces, or leave one open direction for him to run, and wipe him out while he retreats.
To understand the 몬Four swifts and one slow,몭 we should first look at the 몬one slow.몭 It is about moving slowly as you launch your general offensive, and not making any moves unless you몭re fully ready. If you believe you몭re not ready, but you몭ve received orders from above to hurry up the attack, you can disobey those orders. Now let몭s look at the 몬Four swifts몭: 1) When advancing on the enemy position, move swiftly; 2) Once the enemy is between your teeth, swiftly carry out necessary preparation work 멪 surveying the terrain, building and engineering works, packing gunpowder, distributing your firepower, etc.; 3) Once you몭ve made a breakthrough, swiftly expand your battle advantage; 4) Once you몭ve broken the enemy and his forces are retreating, pursue them swiftly.
The 몬Three ferocities몭 are: fighting with ferocity, charging with ferocity, and pursuing with ferocity. Concentrate on a single point, gather your strengths and attack the enemy where he is weak, and then charge and fight with ferocity. As soon as the enemy breaks and retreats, pursue him with ferocity. Lin Biao put particular emphasis on pursuing the enemy with ferocity; it몭s a principle he built into the grassroots of his operations. Whenever he saw his enemy retreating, he would pursue ferociously.
At this stage of battle, don몭t wait for orders, and don몭t bother making any other preparations. In this situation, not preparing is the tactically sound thing to do, and trying to make preparations would actually be a tactical error. Just go after the enemy 멪 don몭t worry about whether you have too few men, whether you might be missing something about the overall situation, or whether your enemy has set an ambush for you. Don몭t even wait to report to your commanding officers. Just chase after the enemy, and once you몭re already moving, send someone back to report to the commanding officers. This philosophy that Lin Biao developed is about preparing properly before going into battle, and then not giving the enemy a second to think or reorganize once the battle has started. Keep them under constant pressure, and charge, fight and pursue with ferocity. Chase him to the ends of the earth, and never stop.


Randomness is always a factor in any single victory or failure; Success that lasts a lifetime is achieved by using successes to neutralize failures

Extract from the original text:
몮If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.몯

Analysis:
If I몭m looking for a fight, there몭s a way I can force him to come out and face me in the open, no matter how high his walls are or how deep his moat. All I have to do is strike in a position that he has no choice but to protect. He may well know what I몭m doing 멪 luring the tiger out of its lair, and setting up a siege in order to destroy the relief force 멪 but he몭ll be forced to go where I want him to anyway, because I몭m attacking in a place that he cannot leave unprotected.
We몭ve already looked at a good few examples of this strategy: besieging the Wei capital to save Zhao from a Wei attack, Sima Yi몭s campaign in Liaodong, etc. I just want to give one more example in this subchapter, this time from the Ming dynasty, when Wang Yangming was tasked with putting down the Prince of Ning Rebellion in Nanchang. As soon as the Prince of Ning launched his insurrection, he attacked the city of Anqing with an army of 60,000 troops. The situation was extremely dangerous 멪 if he succeeded in taking Anqing, the city of Nanjing would virtually be in the bag for him. And, because of Nanjing몭s status as a capital city, as soon as he entered it he몭d have the political capital to proclaim himself Emperor. So, what did Wang Yangming do? He didn몭t try to save Anqing, but instead headed straight for the Prince of Ning몭s powerbase: the city of Nanchang. This left the Prince of Ning with only one option 멪 to abandon Nanchang, occupy Anqing, and then move downriver to Nanjing, where he몭d declare himself Emperor.
So, even though the Prince of Ning had lost Nanchang, he still had an opportunity open to him. The Emperor at the time, Zhu Houzhao (known as the Zhengde Emperor), was a deeply evil man, practically a devil incarnate, widely loathed by common folk and court officials alike. If the Prince of Ning managed to make it into Nanjing and crown himself Emperor, he wouldn몭t have to worry about gaining the support of the people. And yet, he couldn몭t bring himself to abandon his old base, Nanchang, so he forgot the age-old lesson: there몭s no reward without risk. He pulled his troops back to Nanchang, and collided with Wang Yangming몭s army at Poyang Lake. He lost the ensuing battle and was taken prisoner. His whole uprising, the cause he몭d staked his life to, was finished within just 35 days of starting.


몮If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground.몯

If I don몭t want to fight, I just draw a line on the ground. My opponent won몭t dare cross it, because I몭ll make it my job to fill him with uncertainty and doubt about my side of the line 멪 exactly the place he wants to attack. 
In the original Chinese text, the wording for 몬prevent the enemy from coming몭 is unique to the classical Chinese language. The key word (translated here as 몬prevent몭), guai, means 몬well-behaved몭 or 몬clever몭 in modern Chinese. However, its ancient meaning is the opposite: 몬(to make something) counter-intuitive and difficult.몭 So, 몬making it counter-intuitive for the enemy to engage us몭 is about confusing them with trickery and smokescreens. Then, even though the enemy actually is capable of crossing the line we have drawn, he몭ll lack the conviction to actually do so. Cao Cao comments: 몮The meaning of 몬to make counter-intuitive몭 is to make the enemy몭s way forward awkward and difficult. It is a way of presenting gains and risks to the enemy in such a way that he becomes filled with doubt.몯
The most popular and well-known example of this strategy would be Zhuge Liang몭s Empty Fort gambit. As the story goes, Sima Yi was launching an attack on Zhuge Liang몭s fort at the head of a large army. Zhuge Liang only had 10,000 troops, so he didn몭t have the power to stop Sima Yi. If Sima Yi attacked, he몭d be able to take the city virtually without resistance, almost instantly. So, Zhuge Liang, ever cool and collected, opened the gates wide and sent men out with brooms to sweep in the gateway, as if everything was normal. When Sima Yi saw this, he immediately suspected that something was off. Without a doubt, he would have been thinking that Zhuge Liang was trying to make things 몬counter-intuitive,몭 just as The Art of War says. But, what if Zhuge Liang was actually playing some kind of double bluff? Sima Yi knew that he could never determine what Zhuge Liang was up to with any certainty. On top of that, considering Zhuge Liang몭s long-held reputation for caution and aversion to risk, it seemed very likely that there was an ambush force somewhere nearby waiting for him to fall into their trap. So, Sima Yi gave the order to retreat. 
Zeng Guofan also had experience defending cities against attack, and he몭s noted for saying that the absolute best way to defend cities is to use 몬uncanny silence.몭 This just means that when the enemy advances in a rush of noise, with war drums beating at the foot of the city walls, you shouldn몭t respond in any way. Just remain completely silent, and make sure that your soldiers stay hidden out of sight, away from the ramparts. If you do this, even relatively hotheaded attackers won몭t dare try to scale your walls with ladders. And anyway, your typical bandit army doesn몭t have much in the way of siege equipment. They generally like to watch what the defenders are doing, and use that information to decide what their next move should be. So, as a defender, the key is to not do anything at all. Don몭t show them so much as a silhouette; don몭t let them hear so much a single voice. If you do this, the enemy won몭t be able to drum up the energy and excitement they need to fight 멪  they might try a few more rounds of drumming, but eventually they몭ll get bored and leave. 
Let몭s talk a little more about Cao Cao. As far as official Chinese historical records go, there몭s actually no mention of Zhuge Liang몭s Empty City stratagem. So, now let몭s look at how Cao Cao was tricked by Zhao Yun몭s Empty Camp stratagem. During Cao Cao몭s struggle with Liu Bei for control of the strategically important city of Hanzhong, Zhao Yun was in charge of defending Bietun. One day, he몭d left his camp with a few dozen cavalry troops to inspect the local terrain, and he suddenly ran into Cao Cao몭s army. Zhao Yun beat a hasty retreat, fighting as he went, while Cao Cao몭s army chased after in swift pursuit. When Zhao Yun made it back inside his camp, he left the main gate open, and ordered complete silence and stillness. Cao Cao, surveying the scene, seemed to be facing one of two possibilities. Which principle from The Art of War was Zhao Yun using?
A) 몬Making it counter-intuitive for the enemy to engage us몭 멪 trying to scare the enemy off with trickery and smokescreens?
B)   몬Draw the enemy in with the prospect of benefits, then trap him in an ambush몭 멪 had Zhao Yun sent a small force to attack his army and pretend to be beaten, only to lure his pursuit force into the jaws of an ambush?
As Cao Cao pondered the situation, drawing on the lessons of The Art of War, he determined that since he hadn몭t intended to fight a battle that day 멪 and if he hadn몭t run into Zhao Yun, he would never have gone to his camp 멪 it was possible that this was a plan made by Zhao Yun. Zhao Yun was on his home field, while Cao Cao was the visitor. Therefore, Zhao Yun was in a strong position, and he was in a weak position. So, Cao Cao decided that the answer to his question should be 몬B.몭 And that was Cao Cao몭s final answer. He handed in his figurative exam script and pulled his troops back.
The lesson here is that real-life situations are often random.
But we can몭t say that Cao Cao몭s analysis was wrong. Actually, his evaluation was absolutely right, as was his decision-making. Why? After all, it몭s pretty clear that Zhao Yun got the better end of the bargain in that interaction. You just can몭t evaluate decision-making on the basis of a single gain or loss. Leaders have to make countless decisions each and every day, many of them about matters of life and death. Many of these choices create ripple effects that can have profound and long-lasting impacts. It would be impossible to get every decision right. The question is, how do you effectively use pragmatism? And the answer is: use successes to offset defeats, and correct decisions to offset wrong decisions.
In the end, if we몭re going to grade Cao Cao몭s 몬exam script몭 from that day, we have to give him full credit.


The idea of striking where you have a numerical advantage isn몭t about the balance of troop numbers, but weak and strong points

Extract from the original text:
몮By discovering the enemy몭s forms and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy몭s must be divided. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy몭s few. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, then I will be fighting against a limited force. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.몯

Analysis:
몮By discovering the enemy몭s forms and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy몭s must be divided.몯

Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Other people몭s forms are visible, but my forms are invisible. Thus, the enemy must divide his troops to be prepared for me.몯 It몭s about using all kinds of reconnaissance methods to bring the enemy몭s form under a spotlight, or to move the enemy where you want him, exposing the true facts of his situation, so that you can read him like a book. For example, you could use the Chinese concept of 몬reconnaissance by fire몭 멪 take a few shots at him, and watch to see which locations the enemy fires back from.
Reconnaissance isn몭t about probing blindly. You need to approach it with purpose; it should be an exercise in confirming what you basically already know. Napoleon had the habit of mentally rehearsing all kinds of possible situations before fighting a battle. He did this over and over again, often for months beforehand. What will the enemy do if I do such-and-such? Where will the enemy camp? Where will he set up an ambush? Which route will his army take?
When Napoleon arrived at the battlefield, he definitely didn몭t send out scouts with vague instructions to 몬go find out what몭s going on with the enemy.몭 Instead, he would give clear, specific instructions to each reconnaissance team, instructing them exactly where to go to check for any signs of an enemy presence. In other words, Napoleon몭s approach to reconnaissance wasn몭t to cast a wide net, but to send people to very specific locations, along very specific routes, to either confirm or rule out his earlier assessments.
Meanwhile, be invisible. Hide your intentions and your actions, so that the enemy cannot see what the shape of your army is, or where your weak and strong points are. Then, he몭ll have to divide his troops between many different places, just to be ready for anything you might do. Meanwhile, you몭re free to concentrate your troops wherever his weak points are. So, you몭re concentrated, while your enemy몭s divided.

몮We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy몭s few.몯

Du You comments: 몮I can form a single united body, which means that I have more soldiers, while the enemy must split up into fractions, meaning he has fewer soldiers.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮I am able to see where the enemy몭s weak and strong points are, so I need not make excessive preparations, but can concentrate my forces into a single, united body. The enemy, however, cannot do this. He cannot see the form of my army, so he must split up his army into fractions and distribute them between many places, in order to be adequately prepared for me. This means that I can fight with a ten-to-one numerical advantage, so no matter how I choose to fight, the numerical advantage will be mine, and no matter how the enemy fights, he will be outnumbered.몯

몮And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, then I will be fighting against a limited force.몯

Seeing the enemy몭s weak and strong points in a single glance, you can concentrate your troops on a single point, and the enemy won몭t know where you몭re going to attack from. So, he몭ll have to cover all his bases in terms of where he deploys his troops, meaning there will be fewer of his soldiers available to fight you. This is what it means to be able to 몬attack an inferior force with a superior force.몭몯

몮The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.몯


The enemy doesn몭t know where I몭m going to come at him from. He doesn몭t know where the point of engagement will be, so he몭ll need to be prepared to defend against me in more places. The more places he needs to defend, the fewer military assets he몭ll be able to commit to engage my troops. If he beefs up his forward units, he몭ll be weakening his rear units, and vice versa. The same goes for his two flanks. And if he tries to strengthen all of his positions 멪 forward, rear, right and left 멪 he몭ll be weakening himself across the board.

몮Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us.몯

When troop numbers are stretched thin and their battle capability weakened, it몭s because they몭re put in a passive position, forced to plan and account for their enemies. 
When troop numbers are kept high and battle capability strong, it몭s because the commander has been able to force the enemy to plan and account for them.
Du Mu comments: 몮You must not allow the enemy to know where you will engage him. I do not leak any information about my situation, and so the enemy knows nothing about my left and right flanks, my forward and rear positions, how far or close I may be, and what dangers or openings there may be, and nor will he know from which direction I will attack or where our forces will meet. Therefore, he will divide his soldiers so as to guard all possible points of attack. He who keeps his situation concealed will possess numerical superiority; he who divides his troops across most positions will be at a numerical disadvantage. Therefore, victory will surely belong to he who has numerical superiority, while defeat will be the sure fate of he who is disadvantaged numerically.몯

몮For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.몯 

This is the most fundamental principle, and it also applies to everything we do in our own lives. You have to choose one option; you can몭t just have all the options for yourself. If you try to hold on to all the options, then you몭ll end up losing all of them. And yet, humans are greedy 멪 when they get hold of one thing, they immediately start thinking about getting the next thing, and so they ultimately lose both.


When and where should the fighting start? Let the enemy choose

Extract from the original text:
몮Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may march from the greatest distances in order to fight. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred li apart, and even the nearest are separated by several li! Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yue exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting.몯

Analysis:
몮Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may march from the greatest distances in order to fight.몯
If you are capable of predicting where and when a fight몭s going to happen, you몭ll be able to take the fight to the enemy, even if you몭ve just marched 1,000 li.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Use measurements and knowledge of space to find out on what day battle will take place.몯
Meng Shi comments: 몮Using measurements and knowledge of space, you can know the terrain of the battle location, as well as the time when you will encounter your enemy there. Then, you can plan your battle from 1000 li away, and once you arrive, you can set an ambush and wait for your enemy. If, on the other hand, the enemy arrives before you, and takes control of the best terrain, you can choose not to go, leaving the enemy with nothing to show for their efforts. 
Earlier on, we looked at how Wang Yangming destroyed the Prince of Ning. When the prince launched his uprising, he몭d surrounded the city of Anqing with a large army. The reality on the ground was that, if he took Anqing, he몭d be able to move unobstructed down the Yangzi River, and Nanjing would be his for the taking. As soon as he entered Nanjing, he몭d have the political clout to rally more people behind him.
From Wang Yangming몭s position, in order to put down the rebellion, he몭d first have to work out where and on what day his forces would engage the Prince of Ning몭s army. He only had a small, hastily thrown-together army to achieve his aims, so where should the fight take place? Well, since the prince  was at that moment carrying out a ferocious assault on the city of Anqing, of course, he should save Anqing. However, if he did choose to go to Anqing, there was no guarantee that he몭d be able to save the city. The Prince of Ning might actually be preparing for him to march to Anqing 멪 it might even be his plan to use the siege as a way to lure Wang Yangming, and beat him on the road.
 Wang Yangming decided to gamble, but on what? His gamble was to attack the Prince of Ning몭s base, Nanchang, betting that the prince would abandon Anqing and rush back to save Nanchang. If Wang몭s gamble was right and the Prince of Ning did rush back, he몭d have the chance to plan the battle location from afar. So, where should it be? Not at Nanchang. Wang planned to catch the prince near Poyang Lake, while he was still traveling, and fight a decisive battle there. 
This is what it means to 몬know the place and time of the coming battle.몭
Was this a stroke of brilliance by Wang Yangming? Actually, he was just gambling, and it was the only thing he could do. There was also a potentially fatal problem with his plan: what was Wang supposed to do if the Prince of Ning didn몭t come back to Nanchang? If he did decide to give up Nanchang, and just continued his siege of Anqing, the city would be at serious risk of falling. If Anqing fell, Nanjing would be as good as lost, too, and the rebellious prince could march into Nanjing and proclaim himself Emperor.
But, Wang Yangming bet that the Prince of Ning didn몭t have the wisdom or the boldness to pursue this course of action. As it happened, Wang won that bet. As soon as Wang entered Nanchang, the prince immediately called off his siege of Anqing, even though he had the place on the brink of collapse, and pulled his armies back to Nanchang. His bet paid off 멪 after a fierce battle at Poyang Lake, the Prince of Ning became his prisoner.
In our second historical example, Zhou Yafu, a Han dynasty Imperial general, put down a rebellion led by the Liu Pi, Prince of Wu. The prince was looking to attack the capital city, Luoyang, from the east. On the road west, he would have to move through the state of Liang, which had been given to Emperor Jing몭s younger brother, Liu Wu, the Prince of Liang. The rebel armies, from Wu and Chu, inflicted a heavy defeat on the Liang army at Jibi, in the south of Liang. The Liang authorities sounded the alarm bells and requested imperial backup. However, Zhou Yafu was firmly ensconced in his camp, safe behind high walls and a deep moat. Every day, messengers from the Prince of Liang arrived in Zhou Yafu몭s camp, but Zhou Yafu obstinately refused to come to Liang몭s rescue. So, the Prince of Liang wrote a petition to Emperor Jing, who then sent an envoy to Zhou Yafu몭s camp, with orders to come to Liang몭s aid. But Zhou Yafu still didn몭t move. He took the prerogative of the general in the field who does not always listen to his sovereign몭s commands.
While Zhou Yafu let the Prince of Liang and the Wu armies fight a bitter war between themselves, he quietly sent a unit of light cavalry to cut the Wu and Chu supply lines. The Wu army soon was short on grain, and facing the reality of starvation. Liu Pi knew that Zhou Yafu was behind this, so he moved to attack Zhou몭s camp. But Zhou stayed put behind his fortifications; he still had no intention of getting involved in a fight.
As the Wu soldiers struggled to stave off starvation, their fighting capability began to weaken, and so Liu Pi decided to withdraw. Bearing in mind the tenet of 몬knowing the place and the time of the coming battle,몭 Zhou Yafu몭s time had now come, and he몭d chosen the location: an area of level ground in Huaibei. Because the bulk of the Wu army was infantry, fighting on level ground limited the danger for Zhou Yafu몭s imperial Han army, which had a higher proportion of cavalry, while also giving them an advantage 멪 level ground is the absolute best terrain for fighting running battles. With Zhou Yafu in command, the Han army ran the rebel troops off the field and crushed the Wu forces.
It took no longer than three months to put down the Wu and Chu uprisings, which is incredibly fast. Zhou Yafu gained widespread respect and admiration for his vision and his impeccable planning, from the Emperor to the court ministers and imperial generals. But, there was one person who felt nothing but a deep hatred for Zhou Yafu: the Prince of Liang, Liu Wu. The prince was outraged that Zhou Yafu had essentially served him to the enemy on a plate, and left him to fight the entire war on his own, almost losing his fiefdom and his life in the process. From his perspective, all that Zhou Yafu did was to wait until the enemy was almost dead from starvation, and then gave them a little shove. The enemy collapsed, and the victory was chalked up entirely to Zhou Yafu몭s 몬impeccable planning.몭

몮But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred li apart, and even the nearest are separated by several li!몯

Zhang Yu comments that, if you don몭t know where the enemy has gathered his troops, or when the battle will happen, your preparations won몭t be focused and your defensive position will not be sturdy. If you몭re suddenly faced with a powerful enemy thrust, you몭ll be forced to take hasty action, and the different parts of your army won몭t be able to help one another, especially if they are separated over distances of dozens of li.
In both of the two historical examples we몭ve just looked at, the antagonists 멪 The Prince of Ning, Zhu Chenhao (Ming dynasty); and the Prince of Wu, Liu Pi (Han dynasty) 멪 both had the location and timing of their battles dictated by their opponent. How could they not lose?

몮Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yue exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved.몯

Sun Tzu몭s wrote The Art of War for Helu, King of Wu. The states of Wu and Yue had long been enemies, which is why Sun Tzu used Yue as the antagonist in this passage. The story of the war between Goujian of Yue and Fuchai of Wu is a well-known cultural reference point for Chinese people 멪 Fuchai was Helu몭s son.

몮Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting.몯

So, victory can be engineered even if the enemy has more troops, because it몭s possible to put the enemy in a position where he can몭t fight.
In Chapter Four, Formations, Sun Tzu says: 몮One may know how to obtain victory without being able to achieve it,몯 which can also be interpreted as 몬victory may be known, but not engineered.몭 And yet, here he몭s saying that 몬victory can be achieved (engineered).몭 Is he contradicting himself? Actually, no, because the context is different.
He몭s talking about different situations in these two cases. For example, in the case of Wang Yangming몭s conflict with the Prince of Ning, if Wang had had enough resources, or enough time, it would have been a situation where 몬victory can be known, but not engineered,몭 and Wang몭s best choice would be to fight slow and steady. But when the Prince of Ning rebelled, the imperial government was caught unprepared, and Wang was left without the backup of the imperial army. He had to deal with the rebellious prince immediately, with only the resources already at his disposal. Wang couldn몭t let the prince get to Nanjing. In this situation, the only option is to make victory happen 멪 몮Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting.몯 In the end, Wang Yangming몭s gamble paid off. Though the Prince of Ning commanded a powerful force, Wang was able to stop him from attacking Anqing and gaining entry to Nanjing, and managed to summon him to Poyang Lake. In effect, the prince willingly carted himself off to the executioner.


The key tactical elements of knowing yourself and knowing your enemy

Extract from the original text:
몮Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out the ground of life and death. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.몯

Analysis:
몮If you know yourself and you know your enemy, you can fight a hundred battles unscathed.몯 The idea of 몬knowing몭 before fighting a battle is about the 몬Five Factors and Seven Considerations몭 referred to in Chapter One, Calculations. The five factors are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and Discipline. 몬The seven considerations몭 are: (1) Which of the two kings is imbued with the Moral Law? (2) Which of the two generals has the most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater consistency both in reward and punishment?
The five factors and seven considerations deal in terms of politics, resources, strength and strategy. But how do you go about knowing the enemy in terms of tactics, once you몭re already on the battlefield? That몭s exactly what we몭re going to talk about next.

몮Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success.몯

Meng Shi comments: 몮Scheme and measure the enemy몭s situation, and observe his work; thus, you will know the likelihood of success.몯
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮I already know, through my calculation and scheming, the likelihood of the enemy either succeeding or failing.몯
In sum, it몭s basically about analyzing the plans of both yourself and your enemy, and deducing who will win and who will lose.

몮Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.몯

몬Rousing몭 the enemy is about prodding him, irritating him so that he does something unnecessary, and then watching where he moves and where he stays still. Then, you will know where his weak and strong points are. This is also similar to 몬reconnaissance by fire,몭 which we have mentioned before.
Duke Wu of Wei once asked his advisor, Wu Qi: 몮What is to be done if, when my army meets with that of the enemy, I do not know how great or how limited my opponent몭s leadership skills are?몯
Wu Qi replied: 몮Send a small detachment of brave soldiers to launch a stinging attack on him, but order them to feign defeat and retreat as soon as they engage, and then observe how the enemy acts. If his forces pursue your men, but pretend to be unable to keep up, and pretend not to see the weapons, flags and other valuable objects discarded by your fleeing troops, then he is a general of great wisdom. But if they pursue with their entire army in a confused mass of motion and flags, and if they are greedy for spoils and loot, then your opponent몭s leadership skills are second-rate, and you may prepare to launch a general offensive against him directly.

몮Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out the ground of life and death.몯

One way of forcing the enemy to reveal himself is to 몬rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.몭
Du Mu comments: 몮몬The ground of life and death몭 refers to strong and weak points on the battlefield. I must use a multitude of methods to deceive the enemy, observe how he reacts, and then bring him under my control. Thus, I know the 몬ground of life and death.몭몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮If I use weakness to reveal my enemy, I lure him to advance towards me. If I use strength to reveal my enemy, I force him to retreat. When he is advancing or retreating, I know the 몬ground of life and death몭 as concerns the ground he is occupying.몯

몮Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Here, 몬comparing몭 refers to measuring.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮Here, 몬comparing몭 refers to making measurements. I use my areas of abundance to measure the enemy몭s areas of abundance; I use my areas of inadequacy to measure the enemy몭s areas of inadequacy.몯
In the ancient philosophical text, The Guanzi, it is written: 몮Thus, those who are skilled at attacking learn the enemy몭s numbers by attacking them, learn the enemy몭s food stores by attacking his food stores, and learn the enemy몭s level of preparation by attacking his preparations. If the enemy possesses numerical superiority, do not attack; if he possesses superiority in food stores, do not attack; if he is well prepared, do not attack. Stay away from areas of strength, and attack weak points; stay away from places where the enemy is sturdy, and attack where he is weak; stay away from areas of difficulty, and attack where it is easy.몯
For our historical example for this passage, let몭s look back once more at Sima Yi몭s campaign to put down the rebellion in Liaodong. We몭ve already talked about this example twice, and the principle of appraising the enemy몭s plans is yet another point that relates to Sima Yi몭s experience. During that campaign in Liaodong, Sima Yi had 40,000 troops compared to Gong Sunxiao몭s 200,000. As mentioned earlier, Gong Sunxiao sent a vanguard force of a few tens of thousands of troops to guard the River Liao. He personally commanded the main force, which was to act as a relief force for the vanguard, thus blocking Sima Yi몭s forward progress from a distance of several dozen li. Sima Yi used part of his army to pin down the enemy, and then quietly led an elite force around the enemy lines, across the River Liao, and directly to Gong Sunxiao몭s powerbase, the city of Rangping, which he then besieged. This is the stratagem of 몬Forcing him to move by attacking a place where he is bound to come to the rescue; to leave him with no option but to fight, despite having strong defensive fortifications.몭 Gong Sunxiao was forced to move, to protect Rangping, and while on the road, he was defeated three times by Sima Yi몭s forces. He eventually retreated behind Rangping몭s city walls, where he took up a defensive position. This is what it means to 몬surround an enemy position in order to destroy his relief force; know on what day and in what location the battle will be fought.몭
When Sima Yi arrived in Liaodong, it was the seventh month of the year 멪 the beginning of the wet season. Once the rains started, they didn몭t stop for a whole month, so Sima Yi hunkered down with his army and didn몭t move. He was in no rush. One of his officers, Chen Gui, asked him: 몮Back when Meng Da rebelled, we marched against him with eight armies, day and night for eight days. We moved 1,200 li, took Meng Da몭s fortress, and executed him. Today, we have come a great distance to Liaodong, yet we are sitting here, taking our ease, and drawing up plans at a leisurely pace. It must be because of my stupidity, but to tell the truth, I cannot understand this.몯
Sima Yi replied: 몮What we are doing is measuring the enemy몭s numbers and the amount of his food stores. Meng Da did not have many men, and his food stores were enough to feed his army for a year. Our army had four times the numbers of Meng Da몭s, and our food stores were only enough to last for a month. When you have a month몭s store of food, and your enemy has a year몭s, you naturally need to act quickly. That몭s why we had to beat Meng Da, without worrying too much about our own casualties. In truth, it was not Meng Da whom we were fighting against; we were racing against time to finish the war before our food stores ran out. If we failed to do that, our men would have starved to death. As for this campaign, though it is true we have travelled a great distance, we have brought ample food stores, whereas our enemy will soon run out of food. The enemy has more troops than us, so while he starves, we will be well fed. So, the situation now is precisely the opposite of when we fought against Meng Da. This rain does not make for good fighting weather, which is perfect for us 멪 we are all using up our food supplies, so what need is there to hurry?몯
After thirty days, the rain stopped and Sima Yi finally began his attack. In Pingrang, the food shortage was so severe that people had taken to cannibalism. Many enemy officers surrendered, Sima Yi successfully took Pingrang. He executed Gong Sunxiao and restored stability to Liaodong.

Surface-level things 멪 the things that people see and talk about 멪 are never the things that are truly important. There are essentially two threads that contain what is really crucial. The first is the current situation, conditions and pre-planning, and the second is the skill that you, as an individual, have accumulated over many years. Typically, people who learn from other people don몭t have any grasp on the second of these threads, and don몭t even know about the first thread. Their way of studying is to follow the crowd, so naturally their studies amount to nothing.

Extract from the original text:
몮In making tactical dispositions, the highest excellence you can attain is to make them without form; when your dispositions are without form, then you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains. With varying formation, victory is achieved, yet although it is placed before the people, they do not know how it came to be. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.몯

Analysis:
몮In making tactical dispositions, the highest excellence you can attain is to make them without form.몯
몬Making tactical dispositions몭 actually means showing the enemy a certain shape or form in the way your army is deployed. It몭s also about making false movements, which are meant as feints, but might also turn into a real move at any moment. This uncertainty is intentional 멪 it몭s about selling the enemy a deceptive impression, just like Emperor Taizong meant when he said: 몮Use a multitude of diverse methods to fool one몭s foe.몯 The point is to come up with a way, any way, to trick the enemy into slipping up and making an error of judgment. So, 몬In making tactical dispositions, the highest excellence you can attain,몭 and the absolute best way to show the enemy your form is to make your form infinitely variable, to the point that your army becomes 몬without form.몭 Then, the enemy is either completely unable to evaluate your situation, or he accepts a pre-made 몬evaluation몭 that you give to him.

몮When your dispositions are without form, then you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮Here, Sun Tzu says that there is no more perfect way to use armed force than to employ formlessness. When you are formless, then though agents may come deep within my ranks to spy on me, they will be unable to perceive my weak and strong points. Because there is no leaked information about my strengths and weaknesses, even wise and capable men will be unable to devise schemes against me.몯

몮With varying formation, victory is achieved, yet although it is placed before the people, they do not know how it came to be.몯

몬Showing one몭s form몭 is a way of misleading the enemy; 몬formlessness몭 is about the dimensions within which you use your army.  몬Varying formation몭 is about changing your formation and choosing the right approach in response to the enemy몭s situation and unfolding events.
In the original Chinese text, it몭s not entirely clear how readers should interpret 몬although it is placed before the people, they do not understand how it came to be.몭 Li Quan provides a clear explanation in his commentary. In the story of Sima Yi몭s expedition to Liaodong, in the previous subchapter, none of Sima Yi몭s subordinates understood what exactly his plan was, right up until he crushed Gong Sunxiao몭s army and executed the rebel leader. That몭s why we saw Chen Gui asking Sima Yi to explain what was going on.

몮All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.몯

It몭s clear for anyone to see what formation I use, and how I deploy my troops, yet nobody can tell how I responded to the enemy몭s formation so effectively that I won the battle. In the next battle I fight, the enemy몭s situation will be different. And so, because it몭s about responding to the situation in front of me, I won몭t use the same approach, and indeed I never use the same approach twice. There몭s an infinite number of possible variations, which are all based on the situation at hand.
Let몭s look at the meaning of this subchapter몭s heading: 몬If you learn from me, you몭ll survive; if you imitate me, you몭re dead.몭 If you watch how someone else wins a battle, and then try to copy them exactly, you몭ll end up in a terrible mess. Why? Because you haven몭t understood how the person you몭re trying to learn from actually won. He did things a certain way based on the current situation and circumstances. When you try to copy their approach, the situation and circumstances that you몭re facing are completely different. Also, when you saw the general you몭re trying to copy using a certain approach, that approach was not something that just happened in isolation. There was also a wider context of conditions and factors at play before the battle happened, all of which the successful general has to take into account. But you didn몭t do any of this. You just made a crude copy of what you saw, with the mindset that if it worked for other people, then it should work for you, too. And that몭s why it몭s all going to go pear-shaped for you.
Let몭s take another quick look at Han Xin몭s battle by the river, where he put his army of 10,000 men in a place of mortal danger, with their backs to the deep river, and yet he survived. It worked because his men had no escape route 멪 they had to fight and win, or else die. That몭s how they defeated 200,000 enemy troops that day.
But is that really what happened?
If the fighting had lasted a little longer, Han Xin몭s 10,000 troops would have been wiped out. Or, if the enemy commander had ordered his troops to lower their weapons and stand down, some of Han Xin몭s men would have surrendered there and then. But, Han Xin also had a force of 2,000 cavalry, which he used to attack the Zhao camp, tear down the Zhao banners, and replace them with their own Han banners. When the Zhao troops saw that they몭d lost their base camp, they panicked and began to run. That was the moment when the tide turned for Han Xin, when the conditions were right for him to pounce on his enemy.
The crucial factor in that battle was the unit of 2,000 cavalry. We몭re now all familiar with how Han Xin won the battle, even with his back to the river, and the idea of winning with your back to the river has become an idiom in the modern Chinese language. But would you have the courage to intentionally fight a battle with your back to a river? Han Xin himself only did this once 멪 he changed his approach in the very next battle he fought[bd18].
Another important point is that, to study the art of war, you need to also look at it through the lens of a devil몭s advocate. You should spend a lot of time thinking about worst-case scenarios, instead of assuming that things will go well. The first aspect of this is to not study how to make calculations about other people, but how to make other people unable to make calculations about you. Also, don몭t think that you can win by using the formula: 몬I am formless, I show the enemy a form, I deceive the enemy, and then I attain victory.몭 As pleasing as this approach might seem, don몭t allow yourself to be too delighted by it, or when you몭re actually on a battlefield you몭ll find that the fun won몭t last for long. You need to play devil몭s advocate 멪 turn the formula upside down, and as you read each line, imagine yourself as the person who is being 몬shown forms몭 by the enemy. Don몭t allow yourself to be misled, don몭t act without thinking things through, prioritize protecting yourself, and only then allow your thoughts to turn to working out the enemy. This is the true way of the art of war.
We read books and study as a way of projecting what we learn onto ourselves. We take it for granted that we should put ourselves in the role of the winner, and we internalize the emotions and mindset of the winner, because it몭s human nature to do so. But, it몭s important to remember to look at the reverse side of things: to imagine yourself in the role of the loser, and to spend time thinking about how to avoid defeat. This is what you have to do if you want to learn more. 
When studying the art of war, first study how not to lose, and only then move on to how to win. Indeed, the starting point of the whole of the art of war is the question of not losing. The art of war does not begin with victory.


Victory and defeat are not equal; Victory brings nothing more than a few spoils, but defeat means you might lose your life

Extract from the original text:
몮Military forms are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent, and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.몯

Analysis:
This is the final subchapter of Chapter Six, and it shall be used as a summary of Weak Points and Strong.

몮Military forms are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.몯

The way wars are fought is like water. When water moves, it always follows the same pattern: flowing from high places to low places. Similarly, the pattern to follow in war is to stay away from places where the enemy is strong, and strike him where he is weak. Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Water flows smoothly when it is moving downhill, and battles unfold advantageously when striking the enemy몭s weak points.몯

몮Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.몯

The above passage is quite self-explanatory.


몮Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent, and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.몯

Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Energy comes from responding to the enemy.몯 As the enemy changes, I change in response. That몭s why 몬in warfare there are no constant conditions,몭 just as water never stays in any one form. When water comes upon a square-shaped space, it becomes a square, and when it enters a circular space, it becomes a circle. If you can find a way to victory based on how the enemy몭s situation changes, you have practically become a god of war.

몮The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.몯

Each of the five elements 멪 metal, wood, water, fire and earth 멪 subdues one of the other elements, but none of them is able to permanently overpower all of the others. The four seasons 멪 spring, summer, fall and winter 멪 constantly replace one another, and none of them can last for a whole year. The days grow long and then short, and the moon waxes and then wanes. In this passage, Sun Tzu uses all of these natural phenomena as an analogy. He몭s telling us that since all of these things experience periods of growth and decline, how could anyone ever set in stone the constantly fluctuating forms of war? 
We have now reached the end of Chapter Six, Weak Points and Strong. To sum up the chapter몭s essential message, we can look at a comment by Cao Cao: 몮It is about being able to use weak points and strong, both your own and the enemy몭s.몯 As you move your forces this way and that, the objective is to put yourself in a position of strength, and the enemy in a position of weakness 멪 this is how you can become like a god of war.
However, as we learn to fight like a god of war, the most important thing to understand is that you are not a god. It몭s therefore impossible for your troop movements to always put you in a position of strength and the enemy in a position of weakness. More likely, you몭ll find yourself in a position of weakness and your enemy in a position of strength. So, if you can double down on being cautious, you could at least say that your studies of the art of war have not been for nothing. 
Victory and defeat are a question of wisdom, of strength, and also of probability. But, in terms of results, victory and defeat are usually not of equal value. All that you get from victory is some spoils of war, but if you몭re defeated, you몭re liable to lose your life. 
In Questions and Replies between Emperor Taizong of Tang and Duke Li of Wei, there몭s a whole chapter dedicated to weak and strong points, in which Emperor Taizong says: 몮I have read all of the military treatises, and none surpasses Sun Tzu몭s. Within Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, the best of the best is the chapter on Weak Points and Strong. If, as a commander of soldiers, one can distinguish between weak points and strong, then one will sweep to victory wherever one goes. Every general is prone to say that they avoid their enemies몭 strong points while attacking their weak points, yet once they are upon the battlefield, they cannot perceive their enemy몭s weak and strong points. As a result, it is not they who move the enemy where they will, but the enemy who moves them. What do you make of this problem?몯
Duke Li of Wei replied: 몮To perceive weak points and strong, one must first understand 몬the main and the auxiliary.몭 Most military leaders do not know how to use a main force as an auxiliary force and vice versa, so how could they properly identify when a strong point is a weak point, and a weak point is a strong point? The main and the auxiliary are used to manipulate the enemy몭s weak and strong points 멪 where the enemy is strong, I must use my main force; where the enemy is weak, I must use my auxiliary force. Without an understanding of the usages of the main and the auxiliary, then even if one is able to perceive the enemy몭s weak and strong points, one will still be unable to attack them.몯
Then, Emperor Taizong said: 몮When I use my auxiliary force as my main force, my enemy thinks that I am using my auxiliary force, when in fact it is my main force with which I am striking him. Or, the enemy thinks I am using my main force, when in fact it is my auxiliary force with which I am striking him. Thus, the enemy is in a constant position of weakness, while I am in a constant position of strength.몯
This passage ends with a summary by Duke Li of Wei: 몮Countless words have been written on this subject, but essentially, the message never ventures beyond this idea: 몬Manipulate your foe, and do not allow yourself to be manipulated.몭몯
The duke몭s summary forms a pair with the principle of winning by responding to your enemy몭s situation. When the idea of manipulating your foe while avoiding being manipulated yourself is taken to an extreme, it becomes: 몬I don몭t care what your deal is; I only care what my deal is.몭 Above all else, it몭s about not being manipulated by your enemy, not giving him any opportunities and forcing him to endure a long wait. In fact, it몭s totally viable to not even fight at all, because the one thing that you absolutely must do is to win first and fight later.
Winning by responding to the enemy몭s situation is about basing decisions about where you should deploy your troops based on the enemy몭s troop movements. But, when you use this approach, it몭s easy to end up being manipulated and having your movements dictated by the enemy. This is because it몭s possible that the changes you can see in your enemy몭s situation and formation have been intentionally designed to trick you. Perhaps where you see a weak point, the reality is that it몭s the enemy몭s strong point. There몭s a great deal of danger in this strategy, and it몭s not something that just anyone is capable of pulling off.
So, to truly be an all-conquering general, you must be able to 몬manipulate your foe, and do not allow yourself to be manipulated,몭 have a high tolerance for isolation, and be extremely patient. To reach an even higher level 멪 to fight like a god 멪 you need to be able to pluck victory from the changes in your enemy몭s situation.
In all honesty, Emperor Taizong was practically a god. When we try to learn from him, the most important thing is to remember that, unlike him, we are not gods.
Appendix: Complete text of Weak Points and Strong

Sun Tzu said: 몮Whoever is first in the field, and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will be exhausted. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy몭s will to be imposed on him. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move. Appear at points which the enemy will not be quick enough to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack. Oh divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and hence we can hold the enemy몭s fate in our hands. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy몭s weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may march from the greatest distances in order to fight. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred li apart, and even the nearest are separated by several li! Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yue exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out the ground of life and death. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient. In making tactical dispositions, the highest excellence you can attain is to make them without form; when your dispositions are without form, then you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains. With varying formation, victory is achieved, yet although it is placed before the people, they do not know how it came to be. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances. Military forms are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; the four seasons make way for each other in turn. There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing.몯


Chapter Seven
Armed struggle

When you make projections based on the art of war, it all seems so perfect, yet once you몭re on the battlefield, you forget all about the art of war

Extract from the original text:
몮In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp. After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult.몯

Analysis:
Cao Cao comments: 몮Armed struggle is about two armies vying for victory.몯 Once the weak and strong points have been established, then you can maneuver yourself into a tactical advantage.몯 This is why this chapter is positioned immediately after Weak Points and Strong.

몮Having collected an army and concentrated his forces멞몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Assembling the people of the country, forming fighting units, selecting officers, establishing camps 멪 hence battle formations are drawn.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Assembling people from across the country is how armies are built; gathering the soldiers together is how battle formations are drawn.몯
So, what we몭re talking about here is a nationwide mobilization: recruiting soldiers, and then forming armies and sending your forces into the field. 

몮He must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.몯


When you come face to face with the enemy, set up camp.
Cao Cao comments: 몮The gate of an army camp is called the 몬gate of harmony.몭 Gates to the left and the right are called the 몬banner gates.몭 The gate of a camp made of chariots bound together is called the 몬axel gate.몭 The gate of a camp made by men is called the 몬human gate.몭 When the two armies face one another, the different elements of the army are blended and harmonized.몯
There몭s a famous story in China about a warrior named Lu Bu, who managed to avert a battle with a wager that he could shoot a very difficult target 멪 the blade of a halberd, a battle-axe topped with a spike 멪  with an arrow. In the story, Lu Bu is standing by the axel gate. From Cao Cao몭s comment, we know that the name 몬axel gate몭 was used specifically for a gate made of chariot axel rods, while the main gate in an army camp was known as the 몬gate of harmony.몭 He Shi comments: 몮Facing the enemy at the gate of harmony, the general assembles his forces for battle and prepares to vie with the enemy for tactical advantage. This is a difficult task which military commanders face.몯

몮After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮From the time when the general is first appointed, to the moment battle is joined, struggling for advantage is constantly difficult.몯 
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Nothing is more difficult, from being appointed as general, all the way to this juncture.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Standing opposite the enemy and vying with him for advantage is among the most difficult things in the world.몯
To put it simply, this is incredibly hard!
Earlier on, in Calculations, it was all about generals making their plans in the safety of their tents, far away from any real danger.
Later on, in Waging War and Planning Assaults, we talked about scenarios where food supplies are plentiful and armies even got the chance to eat the enemy몭s food, and where generals were free to fight if they thought they could win, or to run away, which they몭d definitely do if they weren몭t sure of winning.
Then, in Formations and Energy, we talked about various situations involving formations and energy, and about organizing armies, deploying troops, and how to come to decisions.
In Weak Points and Strong, we talked about probing the enemy to find out his weak and strong points, how to manipulate him and move him wherever you want, and how to stay clear of his strong points while hitting him where he몭s weak.
It몭s really quite joyful when you talk about it like that 멪  you get to beat your enemy without fighting him. He just surrenders without you having to make a single move. And, even if you do fight, you get to set yourself up in a position where you can몭t be beaten, and you still get to win before you fight. You can cycle your troop organization between main and auxiliary formations, keeping the enemy constantly guessing and never able to work you out. Then, exploiting the space in between weak and strong points, you manipulate your enemy until he몭s more obedient than your own kids. And finally, once you몭ve put him a weak position and yourself in a strong one, you crack him like an egg.
However, you have to remember that if you understand all this, other people understand it, too. If you can do it, others can as well. If you몭re actually doing it, other people are also doing it. Not only that, other people might be doing it better than you. That몭s why you have to 몬struggle,몭 and pit your courage and your wisdom against the enemy몭s. You have to fight to stay one step ahead. And so, the most difficult thing in the world is to find yourself on the battlefield, facing the enemy몭s army, knowing that the fighting몭s about to start.
Mao Zedong once said: 몮As soon as you몭re on the battlefield, you forget all about the art of war.몯
So, how are you supposed to fight? What are the principles? What do you need to remember? These questions are what Armed Struggle is all about.


Sometimes it takes longer than you think it should to do something, but that몭s just life; In the same way, spending money on things you don몭t want to spend money on is part and parcel of spending money

When the right thing to do is admit defeat, admit defeat; when the right thing to do is swallow your objections, swallow your objections. Don몭t fight just for the sake of being right, and don몭t try to right the boat when it몭s already sunk, especially if it means throwing away your capital in the effort.

Extract from the original text:
몮The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the circuitous into the direct, and misfortune into gain. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of the circuitous and of the direct.몯

Analysis:
몮Turn the circuitous into the direct.몯
The quickest way of getting between point A and point B isn몭t to move in a straight line. A route that, on the surface, seems full of twists and turns is actually the easiest, most direct path. There are two reasons for this: terrain, and the enemy몭s formations. Because of these two factors, if you try to move in a straight line, you몭ll find your way forward blocked.
So, when faced with complex terrain and an enemy who is constantly shifting formation, which route is fastest? This is where you 몬turn the circuitous into the direct.몭 The quickest road is actually the one full of twists and turns. In soccer, it would be impossible to attack in a straight line from deep in your own half all the way to the opposition몭s goal posts. So, every time a player runs with the ball or passes it, they are 몬turning the circuitous into the direct.몭 Even for the 몬King of Soccer,몭 Pele, dribbling the ball in a straight line, right into the opposition goal, meant 몭turning the circuitous into the direct몭 every time his foot touched the ball. It몭s about turning adversity into advantage. 

몮Thus, take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, contrive to reach the goal before him.몯

This is about intentionally choosing a long, winding route so as to give the enemy the impression that you몭re not actually planning to go to your destination. Then, you make some false moves and hold out some small enticement to gain control over your enemy, before making a sudden move straight to your destination. This is how you arrive before your enemy, even if you set out after him.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Taking a long and circuitous route is about showing the enemy that you are far away. To arrive before the enemy, even though you depart after him, you must have a clear grasp of measurements, numbers and distances.몯
If you make your enemy think that you몭re far away, they몭ll let down their guard. To arrive before the enemy, you need to work out the terrain ahead of time, including the distances of various routes and where you can cut quickly and suddenly to your destination.
Our historical example for this subchapter comes from Warring States period: how Zhao She defeated a Qin army.
The name Zhao She might sound familiar. That몭s because he was the father of Zhao Kuo, the armchair strategist we talked about earlier. However, unlike his son, Zhao She was a true and renowned general.
When Qin attacked Han, they sent an army to besiege Yuyu. The Zhao king, Huiwen, decided to go to Yuyu몭s aid, so he asked his general, Lian Po, for advice. Lian Po told him that it would be a difficult mission, because the road to Yuyu was long and narrow, and crossed through dangerous, rugged terrain. King Huiwen asked Le Cheng what he thought, and Le Cheng gave the same answer as Lian Po. Then, King Huiwen asked Zhao She, who said: 몮When enemies meet on a narrow road, victory goes to he who is bravest. Leave it to me.몯
When the Qin government found out that Zhao had dispatched an army, they sent a unit to set up a camp to the west of the city of Wu몭an. This, together with their position at Yuyu, put them in a strong position to attack any enemy force from two sides at once.
Zhao She몭s war had just gotten harder.
Zhao She, freshly appointed, gathered an army, marched out of the Handan city gate, and proceeded to set up camp after walking only 30 li. He apparently had no intention of moving any further. He let it be known around the camp, by way of a formal decree: 몮Anyone who speaks out of turn about military arrangements shall be decapitated!몯
Meanwhile, the Qin army was riding a powerful wave of energy and momentum. From their camp outside the city walls of Wu몭an, they beat the war drums to energize the troops, and the noise was so loud that it made the roof tiles inside the city shake.
But, one officer in the Zhao army camp had concerns about the commander-in-chief몭s orders not to move 멪 concerns that were too strong not to express. So, he approached Zhao She, knowing that he was risking his life, and begged him to go to war to save Wu몭an. Zhao She knew that this officer was a good man, but this was exactly what he몭d been waiting for: a good man to come to him and offer his head on a platter. This was part of his plan to 몬turn the circuitous into the direct.몭 So, he immediately ordered that the officer be taken outside and beheaded.
Zhao She kept his army in that camp for 28 days, kept on building up the camp몭s fortifications, and showed no intention whatsoever of moving out to fight. The Qin army sent a spy, and Zhao She put on a show for the agent. He convinced the spy that there was absolutely no chance that the Zhao army would move out, come hell or high water.
When the spy brought this news back to the Qin commander, he was delighted. It seemed to him that the Zhao army didn몭t have the will or the courage to fight him. It was likely that the only reason the force had been sent out in the first place was to make a show of honoring the state of Han몭s plea for help. 
Meanwhile, the moment Zhao She had seen off the Qin spy, he ordered his army to pack up their armor, along with a few, light pieces of equipment and supplies, and he set off. Moving quickly, they arrived safely at Yuyu after two days and one night몭s march, without running into a single ambush or even the slightest whiff of resistance.
Zhao She didn몭t head straight for Yuyu, but stopped about 50 li shy of the city, and set up camp in a location he몭d selected specially for its good terrain. At this point, another of his officers, a man named Xu Li, stepped forward and put his neck on the line by suggesting to Zhao She: 몮Victory will surely belong to whoever holds the northern mountains.몯 Zhao She immediately agreed with the man, and sent 10,000 troops to set up a position at the highest point in the northern mountains. 
Xu Li, who몭d suggested the mountain defense, said: 몮I have said my piece, and I am prepared to accept my death.몯
몮And why should you be put to death?몯 Zhao She asked.
몮Because멞 your decree! 몬Anyone who speaks out of turn about military arrangements shall be decapitated,몭몯 Xu Li replied.
몮We shall discuss this matter further upon our return to Handan,몯 Zhao She said, ending the discussion. (When the army eventually returned to Handan, Xu Li was promoted and given an official title: Defender in Chief.)
The Qin commander, hearing that the Zhao army had reached Yuyu, broke out in a cold sweat. He immediately pulled his army back from Wu몭an and rushed to protect the Qin position at Yuyu. But Zhao She already held the best terrain, so he won a major victory over the Qin army, resulting in the end of the Qin siege of Yuyu.
The story of this battle is a particularly gripping one.
Traveling unarmored, and with only light supplies, is a very dangerous move. After a forced march lasting two days and a night, without any supply wagons, the Zhao army had moved far away from its rear support system, and the soldiers would have been exhausted. If Zhao She had rushed straight into a confrontation with the Qin army under Yuyu몭s city walls, without pausing for a rest, he likely would have ended up as a Qin prisoner. Zhao She몭s stroke of genius lay in the fact that he camped 50 li outside of Yuyu, set up a proper defensive line and fortifications, and dug in, waiting for the Qin army to come to him. In doing this, he was putting into practice a key lesson from Weak Points and Strong: 몮Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will be exhausted.몯 If one of the two sides was exhausted, it was definitely the Zhao troops 멪 they would have been utterly spent after their forced march. But instead of heading straight for Yuyu, they pulled up 50 li short, meaning that the Qin soldiers basically had to run a marathon to get to them, wearing themselves out in the process. This turned the tables 멪 the Zhao troops rested up while they waited for their enemies to tire themselves out on the road to the battlefield.
Also in the chapter on Weak Points and Strong, we read how Duke Li of Wei said that in all the thousands of pages written about the art of war, there is nothing that isn몭t essentially saying: 몬Manipulate your foe, and do not allow yourself to be manipulated.몭 At first, the Qin army had everything planned out. They thought they were manipulating Zhao She, because they몭d set up strong, mutually reinforcing positions at Wu몭an and Yuyu, and planned to use the stratagem of besieging a city with the main purpose of drawing in an enemy relief force, under Zhao She몭s command, and destroying it on the road. But as it turned out, the Qin forces weren몭t able to catch Zhao She, because he successfully 몬turned the circuitous into the direct,몭 materializing as if by magic outside Yuyu with his army. Once Zhao She had put the finishing touches to the location he몭d chosen for a battlefield, the roles had reversed: Zhao She was to be the gracious host, and the Qin army was to be his guests. They had to go exactly where Zhao She wanted them. 
Another passage from Weak Points and Strong says: 몮Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may march from the greatest distances in order to fight.몯 Again, Zhao She did it by the book, choosing both the time and the location of the battle.
However, there몭s one question that must be asked: What it the Qin army didn몭t show up?
This was actually an option for the Qin commander 멪 once he found out that Zhao She had used the stratagem of 몬turning the circuitous into the direct,몭 and made his way to Yuyu, he could have thought things through more thoroughly. He might have realized that, since it was now a fact that the Zhao army was here, he could just work out how many days the isolated enemy force could realistically last without grain and supply wagons. He could have waited and watched, and postponed making any firm decisions. But he didn몭t. He panicked, because something had happened that he wasn몭t expecting, and because he didn몭t know what other moves Zhao She might have up his sleeve. So, he allowed himself to be swept up in his panic, and hurried off to fight. He returned from the battle that followed as a badly beaten general.
A different commander might not have fallen into Zhao She몭s trap. That would have been a real problem. In the story we looked at earlier of Wang Yangming putting down the Prince of Ning몭s rebellion, Wang Yangming really only had one card in his hand: attacking the city of Nanchang and waiting for the Prince of Ning to come to its rescue. This strategy was also an example of 몬turning the circuitous into the direct.몭  But what if the Prince of Ning didn몭t come to save Nanchang? His advisors all tried to tell him that losing Nanchang wasn몭t a big deal, because if he only managed to take Nanjing he몭d become the Emperor of all China, and he몭d be able to take back control of Nanchang by just sending a letter! But the prince panicked. He went back to Nanchang, not knowing that he was marching to his death.
In both cases, the panicked commander was like a rabbit in the headlights, choosing an escape route on blind impulse.
It몭s important to not panic, and to be able to admit defeat. Once you admit defeat, and acknowledge that the circumstances have changed, you can work out what to do about it. What you mustn몭t do is keep thinking about how to turn back time and re-create the old situation. Also, don몭t throw your capital away in an attempt to claw back your advantage. If you do that, you몭ll lose everything.
Finally 멪 and this is a bit of a tangent 멪 when you use the stratagem of 몬turning the circuitous into the direct,몭 you몭re still going after 몬the direct.몭 However, in life and personal growth, the road is inherently full of twists and turns, of forward movement and backward steps. Nothing ever goes entirely smoothly, and you can never move in a perfectly straight line. So, you have to understand this at a basic level. A winding road is a road, too, and money you don몭t want to spend is just the same as any other money. If you refuse to take the winding road, you몭ll find yourself without any road at all, and if you refuse to spend money that you don몭t want to spend, you won몭t spend money when it몭s the right thing to do.


Marching is part of war, and so is camping

If you take this logic a step further, you몭ll find that training troops is also a part of war. In fact, it몭s an even more important element of war than fighting battles. Actually, fighting is the least important part; all the variables solidify and take their final form well before the battle happens. Yet, when people talk about war, they always talk about battle stories. It몭s very rare to hear stories about camping, and you almost never hear stories about training, because 몬training몭 and 몬stories몭 don몭t go together. So, the real work of wars all happens away from the limelight of storytelling. That몭s exactly what Sun Tzu meant when he said: 몮Good fighters have neither a reputation for wisdom nor merit for courage.몯 True heroes don몭t make it into the storybooks.

Extract from the original text:
몮Armed struggle can be advantageous, and it can be dangerous. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, you will be too late. On the other hand, abandoning the army for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their armor, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred li in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination. If you march fifty li in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal. If you march thirty li with the same objective, two thirds of your army will arrive. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.몯

Analysis:
몮Armed struggle can be advantageous, and it can be dangerous.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮For a skilled general, it is advantageous; for an unskilled general, it is dangerous.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮When a wise general engages in armed struggle, he does so to his advantage; when a mediocre general engages in armed struggle, he endangers himself. The wise general understands the circuitous and the direct; the foolish general is ignorant of the workings of the circuitous and the direct.몯
To put it plainly, nothing몭s difficult if you know how to do it. If you know how to snatch an advantage from your enemy몭s hands, you몭ll do well; if you don몭t, you몭ll end up putting yourself in danger. For example, in the previous subchapter, Zhao She was able to successfully gain the advantage by marching light and fast for two days and a night, because he understood the stratagem of 몬turning the circuitous into the direct.몭 So, he was able to manipulate his enemy while avoiding being manipulated himself, and he was able to foretell the time and location of the battle. Zhao She put into practice the principle that 몬armed struggle can be advantageous몭 by marching 100 li to fight. But, if he몭d done exactly the same thing without first committing to do all the groundwork and showmanship that went into fooling the Qin general, he would have played straight into his enemy몭s plan, which was to besiege the cities of Wu몭an and Yuyu with a primary objective of luring in and destroying a relief force. If Zhao She had been lured in and crushed, he would have been proving the other side of the equation: 몬armed struggle can be dangerous.몭
This is why, so often when we see someone else smartly pulling off a certain strategy, we fail spectacularly when we try to do the same thing. This is because people aren몭t the same, and there are different levels of preparation that go into making these things either work or backfire.

몮If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, you will be too late. On the other hand, abandoning the army for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.몯

A 몬fully equipped army몭 means that, along with the soldiers and horses, you몭re marching with full armor, weapons and other equipment, grain and heavy supply wagons. This makes for slow travel, hence the phrase, 몬you will be too late.몭 So, when the crucial moment arrives, you have to leave your heavy supply wagons behind and move quickly, with just a light cavalry force. This is the meaning of 몬abandoning the army to snatch the advantage.몭 Similarly, 몬the sacrifice of its baggage and stores몭 means giving your supplies to someone else. Who exactly you give them to is impossible to know, but you몭re essentially throwing them away.

몮Thus, if you order your men to roll up their armor, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred li in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.몯

몬Rolling up the armor몭 is about packing just the essential armor and riding light. In this situation, your unit marches all through the day and all through the night, without rest. If you make a forced march with three separate units over a distance of 100 li in a bid to seize the advantage, your three commanders will all be taken prisoner by the enemy. Why? The men who are in the best physical condition will be able to make it to the destination without any rest, but the weaker ones will straggle behind. So, only one tenth of the units몭 troops will arrive on schedule, and your unit will have drastically shrunk in size, to the point that it doesn몭t matter much where they are, because the enemy will be able to swallow them up. Also, the enemy will be fresh and well rested, while your men wear themselves out on their journey. All the enemy has to do is wait for your men to walk, in scattered groups, right into their open jaws.
In the Battle of Fei River, which we looked at earlier in the book, I wrote that Xie Xuan had an army of 80,000 men, and that he defeated Fu Jian몭s much larger army of 800,000. But actually, although Fu Jian몭s army did indeed number 800,000 troops in total, not all of them arrived in time. Many of his soldiers were still on the road when the battle started, and it몭s unclear in the historical records exactly how many made it to the battlefield on time. Xie Xuan had inside information, thanks to his secret ally, Zhu Xu, so he knew that Fu Jian hadn몭t yet assembled his whole army. That몭s the only reason Xie Xuan decided to launch a lightning-speed attack.
In ancient Chinese warfare, armies would normally march 30 li, on average, per day. On forced marches, this speed would double, to 60 li per day. If marching 몬without halting day or night,몭 another 40 li could be covered, adding up to a total of 100 li over the course of a whole day and a whole night. So, since we know Zhao She marched for two days and one night, he probably covered a distance of 160 li. According to The Art of War, he should have been captured by his enemy. What was his solution? To camp and set up defensive lines a full 50 li before reaching the enemy, partly to give the stragglers time to catch up, as well as to eat and rest. And, he did so to force the enemy to march the remaining 50 li, tiring out the enemy troops while he waited at his leisure.

몮If you march fifty li in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.몯

Zhao She implemented this passage to the letter: 50 li was the distance he left for the Qin army to march on their way to meet him. The Qin forces underwent a forced march to cover those 50 li as quickly as possible, with the result that only half of their force initially arrived, while the other half, including high-ranking officers, was still on the road. This would have made life quite difficult for the soldiers that arrived first.

몮If you march thirty li with the same objective, two thirds of your army will arrive.몯

Even marching at a normal speed 멪 30 li per day 멪 the army will still become separated, with two thirds of the troops reaching the destination before the remaining third.  

몮We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.몯

Here, the 몬baggage-train몭 includes battle equipment, grain, clothing and other consumable supplies. 몬Bases of supply몭 means roughly the same thing: goods, valuables and other commodities. 
So, an army that marches quickly like this is, in reality, extremely vulnerable. Without their baggage-train, they몭re dead; without supplies and equipment, they몭re dead. Think about conditions during the Korean War 멪 soldiers without winter clothing and blankets were doomed. Whole regiments and whole army camps froze to death on the front lines.
This passage from The Art of War contains three truths.
The first truth is that accomplishing something isn몭t difficult if you have the right abilities, but it몭s impossible if you don몭t. Challenges can bring huge benefits for wise leaders, but death and disaster for foolish leaders. If you see someone doing something, but don몭t understand how they do it, don몭t make the mistake of thinking that if someone else can do it, you can too.
The second truth is that marching is a part of war, and is in fact an even more important element than fighting in battles. The Art of War also states that camping is a part of war. Questions like where and when to set up camp can be even more pivotal in determining who will win or lose a conflict than the actual process of fighting. By the time the fighting starts, who will win and who will lose is a foregone conclusion; what makes the difference is the commanders몭 decisions about marching and camping. These factors are exactly what decided Zhao She몭s victory over the Qin forces.
There몭s a famous quotation from Napoleon: 몮Marching is war, and war is marching. Ability in conducting wars is one and the same as the ability to move effectively.몯 Napoleon specifically researched different marching speeds. Traditionally, an army was supposed to be able to march 70 paces per minute, but Napoleon upped this speed to 120 paces per minute. So, Napoleon몭s main battle weapon wasn몭t his soldiers몭 guns, but their legs. Another leader who was especially skilled at marching was General Su Yu, of China몭s People몭s Liberation Army. He understood the stratagem of 몬turning the circuitous into the direct몭 better than anyone, and he was able to memorize maps of entire war zones in full detail. This talent enabled him to cut across the terrain with incredible speed, and to appear out of nowhere, where his enemies least expected.
If we take the logic of marching and camping being integral parts of warfare to the next step, we realize that training is also an integral part of warfare, and that it too is even more important than actual fighting. A bit of extra work and sweat in peacetime saves a lot of blood in times of war.
If you take this logic yet an additional step further, you몭ll find that training troops is also a part of war, and in fact, it몭s an even more important part of war than fighting battles. Actually, fighting is the least important part; all the variables solidify and take their final form well before the battle happens. Still, when people talk about war, they always recount battle stories. As we몭ve said, it몭s rare to hear stories about camping, and you almost never hear stories about training, because 몬training몭 and 몬stories몭 don몭t go together. The real work of wars all happens away from the limelight[bd19] of storytelling. That몭s exactly what Sun Tzu meant when he said: 몮Good fighters have neither a reputation for wisdom nor merit for courage.몯 True heroes don몭t make it into the storybooks.
The third truth is that armies are extremely vulnerable and fragile. If you stop paying attention for even a moment, you몭re dead. The strongest thing in the world is also the weakest and most delicate. In the times when we feel strong and powerful, we need to be even more careful than usual. Observe yourself 멪 are you really so powerful, or are you actually very weak?
Behind the simple words, 몬Know the terrain,몭 there are countless details, and countless people몭s sweat, wisdom and lives

Extract from the original text:
몮We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of neighboring lords. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country 멪 its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and obstructions, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.몯

Analysis:
몮We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of neighboring lords.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮Without knowing the enemy몭s situation and details of their plans, one cannot form alliances with them.몯 If you don몭t know the politics and motives of neighboring powers, you don몭t have the ability to decide your own diplomatic policy, and you can몭t count on other people helping you.
A passage from earlier in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War tells us: 몮Thus the highest form of generalship is to attack the enemy몭s plans; the next best is to attack the enemy몭s alliances.몯 If you want to engage in diplomacy and get it right, you need a clear idea of what the various parties몭 interests and motives are. This is an idea from game theory, the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction between decision-makers. So, The Art of War isn몭t just a work of military strategy, it몭s also hailed by game theory scholars as the earliest game theory text.
Any behavior that contains elements of competition or antagonism can be called 몬game theory behavior.몭 Within this category of behavior, every side involved, or every competitor, has different goals or interests. The different sides, in order to achieve their various goals, have to contemplate all of their adversaries몭 possible moves or action plans, and also do whatever it takes to choose the right action plan for themselves. They need to pursue a course of action that몭s as rational as possible, or maximizes benefits for them.
In game theory strategy, one very important principle is that you mustn몭t look at the game just from your own perspective and your opponent몭s perspective, or just in terms of your and your opponent몭s interests, and the demands under which you and your opponent are operating. Instead, you need to expand your understanding of the number of participants in the game, or even to completely remodel the game, adding in more people and interests which might at first glance seem irrelevant to the game, while also increasing the number of chips you have in the game. War, too, isn몭t just a game between two sides. By expanding your understanding of the number of participants in the game of war, by bringing more states and various other factors into the picture, you stand to gain support from unlikely or hidden sources, and increase your chances of winning. For example, if you connect the dots between the 몬Crimea Issue몭 between Russia and Ukraine, on the one hand, and the Diaoyu (Senkaku in Japanese) Islands issue between China and Japan, a regional game becomes a global one.

몮We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country 멪  its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and obstructions, its marshes and swamps.몯

Cao Cao breaks down this passage in his commentary: 몬mountains몭 refers to places of commanding height; 몬forests몭 refers to places containing many trees; 몬pitfalls몭 refers to moats and other deep holes in the earth; and 몬obstructions몭 refers to vertically uneven terrain. 몬Marshes몭 refers to damp, boggy places, full of water and grasses; and 몬swamps몭 refers to places where water from many sources converges and becomes stagnant (i.e., lakes and ponds).
In short, you need to be extremely clear about the terrain before leading an army out on the march.

몮We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides.몯

If you don몭t take seriously the need to use local guides, you won몭t be able to gain control of the best terrain.
Studying and researching terrain from a strategic perspective is extremely intensive and detail-heavy work. It몭s common knowledge that before the Normandy landings in World War II, the Allies took their reconnaissance of the terrain they몭d be navigating in France to an extremely high level of detail. They sent spies during the night to dive in Normandy몭s coastal waters, where they took samples of beach sand and mud. They then evaluated all sorts of metrics, such as the thickness of the sand layer, the amount of mud, its relative hardness or softness, whether or not tanks could be driven onto the beaches, and so on. In the end, the Ally researchers concluded that the sand was too soft, and that tanks would get stuck. What was their solution? The plan was to send a single tank ahead of the rest, the front part of which would be loaded with a 몬carpet몭 made of canvas and wooden boards, which it would lay down on the beach so that the rest of the tanks would have a good surface to drive on.
And how did the Allies deal with anti-tank obstacles? Again, they sent a single tank ahead of the rest, which welded a bomb onto the anti-tank obstacle and blew it up. At that point, soldiers jumped out of the tank, wrapped cables around the obstacle 멪 now reduced to a heap of scrap iron 멪 and dragged it out of the way.
Moving further up the beach, the next barrier to overcome would be rows of landmines. For this, the Allies designed a special mine-clearing tank, a great monstrous machine mounted with a horizontal bar on two arms at the front.  From these arms hung a cluster of steel wrecking balls. As it drove forward, the wrecking balls hit the ground in front of the tank, detonating any landmines and clearing a way for troops behind to move forward.
If it weren몭t for this extremely intensive and detailed reconnaissance work, as well as the subsequent, highly-targeted design and engineering work, many, many more people would have died on those Norman beaches.
So, when we talk about 몬knowing the terrain,몭 it seems simple 멪 it몭s just three words. Yet, behind these words there are countless details, as well as the sweat, wisdom and lives of countless people.


The idea that 몬War is built on deception몭 plays the same role as feints in soccer; It몭s not actually a fundamental part of The Art of War, and it certainly is not representative of its value system

Extract from the original text:
몮In war, make deception the foundation upon which to stand, move with advantage, and change by dividing and consolidating.몯

Analysis:
The first part 멪 몮In war, make deception the foundation upon which to stand몯 멪 is a little misleading. Some readers consider these words the philosophical heart of The Art of War. To them, it seems perfectly clear: Sun Tzu is telling us to 몬make deception the foundation,몭 so it seems only natural that deception should also serve as a broader theoretical foundation. However, in the context of The Art of War as a whole, 몬The Five Factors and Seven Considerations몭 don몭t come from deceit, and neither does 몬Win first, fight later.몭 
So, it몭s important, when you몭re reading a book or listening to someone speak, to make links between the different parts of the book or speech. Experts in the field of linguistics tell us that any given text can only communicate a small fraction of the writer몭s thoughts. To get a complete picture of what the person behind the text is thinking, you need to integrate the language of the text with the wider context. We can몭t just lift a single sentence that someone몭s said out of its context, thinking we can explain what it means in isolation. Likewise, we can몭t presume to magnify it by inserting it into a completely different context. If you do that, we몭ll veer way off course from the author몭s original idea.
When Sun Tzu wrote the line, 몮Make deception the foundation upon which to stand,몯 he was writing in the context of this chapter, Armed Struggle. Here, he몭s beginning to talk about deception now that we몭ve reached the stage where the two sides몭 armies fight it out for victory. That comes only after going through the steps of making calculations in the temple, planning your assault, and thinking about formation and energy.
What is deception? The simplest way to explain it is with a concept from soccer: false movement, also known as the 몬feint.몭 You could say that every time your foot is about to touch the ball, there몭s always the potential for a feint 멪 a deceptively faked move. Deceit is a way of concealing your intentions; of fooling your enemy and making them go where you want them to go. Like Emperor Taizong said, it몭s about finding some way to lure your enemy into making a mistake.
In the context of football, 몬deceit몭 takes the form of feints. But, when you몭re training a soccer team, you can몭t just practice feints. In war, you make deceit your foundation, but if you also turn deceit into your entire value system, and believe that only deceitful people can get things done, you몭ll end up tricking not just your enemy, but also yourself. You몭ll start to believe your own lies.

 
몮Move with advantage.몯

This bit of text also has multiple possible meanings. What몭s your understanding of the word 몬advantage?몭 Does it just mean 몬Anything that might benefit you?몭 But if you몭re prepared to move at the first sight of benefit, aren몭t you liable to be tricked into moving if your enemy uses the illusion of benefit to fool you? So, 몬advantage몭 means 몬Something that is actually beneficial to you.몭 You should only move when doing so benefits you along the road to victory.
You might think, 몬Well, that몭s pretty obvious! Of course you should only move when it몭s of benefit to you. It goes without saying, doesn몭t it?몭
Actually, it does need to be said. That몭s because our failure to put into practice the principle of only moving when it gives you an advantage is our biggest weakness. So often, we move not because we stand to gain any real advantage, but because we feel anxious or under pressure, or because of greed or anger. 
The 몬advantage principle몭 is the most important tenet to put into practice whenever we몭re trying to get something done. Don몭t preoccupy yourself with the past 멪 no matter what might have happened before, the only thing you need to get a firm grip on is how to take your next step in a way that gives you an advantage.
몬Moving with advantage몭 doesn몭t mean moving at the first sight of an advantage. It몭s about only moving if doing so actually gives you an advantage.
It몭s just a few words, and yet the vast majority of people will never, in their whole life, successfully put them into practice. Otherwise, what business would these words have being part of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War?

몮Change by dividing and consolidating.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Each act of division and each consolidation is a change undertaken in light of the enemy몭s situation.몯
Changing an army by 몬division and consolidation몭 is exactly the same thing as allocating main and auxiliary forces. In the vocabulary of The Art of War, this is also known as 몬the art of division,몭 and the overarching term for this strategy is 몬dividing and consolidating the main and auxiliary.몭 Duke Li of Wei said: 몮If your troops are scattered, consolidate them into an auxiliary force; if your troops are consolidated, divide them into an auxiliary force. Thus, repeatedly ordering your forces to consolidate and divide, you return into the main.몯
몮In war, make deception the foundation upon which to stand.몯 This plays a role similar to the feint in soccer. It몭s not actually the foundation of the art of war, and it몭s definitely not part of the art of war몭s core value system. 몬Moving with advantage몭 doesn몭t mean moving at the first sight of a possible benefit; it몭s about only moving when doing so brings you some kind of advantage.

몮Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest. In attacking and ravaging the enemy, be like fire; in immovability, like a mountain.몯

Analysis:
These four lines have had a bigger impact in Japan than any other part of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War. I say this because, during Japan몭s Sengoku period of prolonged war between feudal states (1467-1615 CE), a feudal lord named Takeda Shingen had these lines written in gold lettering upon a piece of cyan cloth, and he made this his battle flag. It was known as the 몬Flag of Sun Tzu.몭
Let몭s start by looking at what these lines mean.

몮Let your rapidity be that of the wind.몯

Li Quan comments: 몮This is about advancing and retreating. When you advance, leave no trace of yourself; when you retreat, move with the utmost speed.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮It is about striking at emptiness.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Advance with explosive speed, and you will sweep away all in your path.몯
So, 몬let your rapidity be that of the wind몭 has two parts: attacking and retreating. When you attack, be as fast as the wind, and when you retreat, leave no trace. Cao Cao adds on an extra meaning, which is that you should 몬strike at emptiness.몭 This means that you need to be able to judge the enemy몭s weak and strong points, to do what they least expect 멪 to attack them where they몭re unprepared, and to avoid their strong points while striking their weak points. If you do all this, you will sweep away all in your path, and you will be as fast as the wind.

몮Let your compactness be that of the forest.몯

This line is talking about battle lines drawn up as neatly and tidily as the trees in a forest. If you move slowly and deliberately, there will be no gaps in your lines for your enemy to exploit.
Li Quan comments: 몮Making your battle lines orderly, and then moving.몯 You can imagine it like this: an entire army in battle formation, moving as a single unit, like a forest full of trees swaying. The army advances slowly and quietly, embodying a powerful sense of constriction, like being inside a huge forest.
Du Mu comments: 몮몬Compactness몭 is about being slow and steady. When ordering the army to move slowly and steadily, the ranks and columns must be like trees in a forest, in case the enemy may attempt a surprise attack.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮This is for times when there is no advantage to see.몯 This echoes the line from the previous passage about 몬moving with advantage.몭 If you haven몭t yet been able to identify the enemy몭s weak and strong points, and if you haven몭t seen any opportunity to attack that would give you the advantage, you should move slowly and cautiously.
Du You comments: 몮Do not move forward if you see no advantage. Be like a forest when the wind blows through it, making some small movements, but no big ones.몯

몮In attacking and ravaging the enemy, be like fire.몯

When moving in for the attack, be like a raging fire. Li Quan comments: 몮Be like a blazing inferno burning across a prairie; leave not a single blade of grass unburned.몯 His addition of 몬leave not a single blade of grass몭 is telling us that the enemy should be left with nowhere to run and no way to resist. Not a single enemy soldier should be allowed to escape. Lin Biao몭s 몬three ferocities몭  멪 fight ferociously, charge ferociously and pursue ferociously 멪 are a modern equivalent to this line from Sun Tzu.
Cao Cao몭s comment repeats what he said earlier: 몮It is about being fast.몯

몮In immovability, be like a mountain.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮This is about holding a defensive position.몯 When your army is not in motion, it should be like a mountain: unshakeable.
A text by the ancient philosopher Xunzi, entitled A Debate about Warfare, says this: 몮When holding a position, form strong lines on all sides, and you will become like a massive boulder; whatever beast may charge you, its horns shall shatter upon impact.몯
The metaphor of 몬wind, forest, fire and mountain몭 is about using speed, as well as caution. The ancient military text, the Wei Liaozi, says: 몮In heaviness, be like the mountains and the forests; in lightness, be like fire and cannon smoke.몯 So, when attacking and withdrawing, be like wind and fire, and when you몭re not moving, be like the mountains and forests.
How should we understand 몬wind, forest, fire and mountain몭 from the perspective of Takeda Shingen?
For him, there were two levels to being as swift as the wind. The first level was about how he used cavalry. He had the best cavalry in all of Japan, and he typically began his battles with a cavalry charge. The second level was about strategy and infrastructure, which had two main parts. The first part was beacon towers used for communicating signals. Takeda Shingen built a dense network of signal towers radiating out in all directions from his base in Kai Province. If anything unusual happened in his border territories, smoke of various colors would be used to report to Takeda Shingen, enabling him to react, and possibly mobilize troops, at the fastest possible speed. The second part was his famous road system, known as the Shingen Bomichi roads. Kai Province is located in mountainous terrain, so Shingen Takeda built nine extremely straight roads that allowed his armies could move more effectively. All nine roads led directly to major war zones. So, with the support of information and transport infrastructure, Shingen Takeda몭s armies were able to move as swiftly as the wind.
What about the second part, 몬Letting your compactness be that of the forest?몭 Again, there were two levels. First, this relates to Takeda Shingens몭 rifle units. Each soldier in these units carried a long gun, between four and six meters in length. When these rifles were held upright, the unit would have looked just like a forest. These units would move slowly, and they were a potent weapon against enemy cavalry forces. The second level is about the army as a whole 멪 when ordering his men to move out, they did so in perfect order, moving fluidly and serenely, as a single unit.
Moving on to the next line 멪 몬In attacking and ravaging the enemy, be like fire몭 멪  for Takeda Shingen, this was first about charging the enemy with irresistible force, like a blazing wildfire surging over grasslands. Secondly, it was about his system for organizing his army and communicating commands. The idea was to be able to command his forces so seamlessly that it was as if they were an extension of his own arm, moving wherever he pointed his finger.
Next, we have 몬In immovability, be like a mountain.몭 First of all, for Takeda Shingen, this was about how he conducted himself as an individual. No matter how intense the situation around him might be, he would be able to rise above the flames of battle and continue directing his army. It was about being untouched by the commotion around him. Even if enemy soldiers advanced right up to where he sat, he wouldn몭t so much as stand up 멪 he would let his bodyguards kill the attackers. This is about the commander being immoveable and the army몭s battle flag remaining untouched. This is the way to keep your soldiers몭 hearts steady, and to fill them with the courage to kill the enemy.
The next part of 몬immovability몭 is about the discipline of Takeda Shingen몭s army, and the way he managed his battle lines. Every member of his army would be positioned according to his own, specific role, and if anyone showed the slightest sign of non-compliance, they were dealt with by martial law. This meant that no matter what kind of attack Takeda Shingen몭s enemies might try, his troops never wavered, never left their position in the army몭s battle lines, and never allowed the enemy to affect them. So, from Takeda Shingen himself, down the hierarchy to every single member of his army, the whole organization was as immovable as a mountain.
Next, it몭s time to look at how this passage relates to Takeda Shingen몭s strategy. He never acted without thinking through the possible consequences, and he never allowed the enemy몭s attempts to probe him provoke him into action. He moved in step with his own rhythm 멪 slowly and steadily, like the trees in a forest, and immovable like a mountain. Yet, as soon as an opportunity presented itself, he would strike with the speed of the wind and the raging intensity of fire.
Wind, forest, fire and mountain 멪 through these elements, Takeda Shingen brought Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War into the real word in a very big way.
Takeda Shingen practically worshipped Sun Tzu. In a television drama series filmed by Japanese public broadcaster NHK, entitled Takeda Shingen, there is an episode in which a Chinese Buddhist monk visits Kai Province, Takeda Shingen몭s stronghold. Takeda Shingen invites the monk into his home, and recites these passages of The Art of War to him, in Japanese:
몮sono?haya kikoto?kaze nokotoku,?
sono?shizu kanarukoto?hayashinokotoku,?
shingyaku surukoto?hi nokotoku,?
ugo kazarukotono yamano.몯
Then, Takeda Shingen made a request of the Chinese monk:
몮Would you recite for me the words in Chinese, so that I may know how they sound?몯 
The monk courteously accepted, and began to recite the words in a soft voice:
몮qi ji ru feng,
qi xu ru lin,
qinlue ru huo,
bu dong ru shan.몯
Takeda Shingen closed his eyes, immersed deeply in his enjoyment of these heaven-sent sounds.


The military practice of looting: An army몭s 몬unofficial welfare benefit몭

Any organization is always going to need some kind of benefits. But, the problem with official benefits is that people feel that they몭re entitled to them. And then, as soon as they begin taking them for granted, the benefits몭 incentive mechanism breaks down or even goes into reverse, encouraging laziness. So, you몭re always going to need a few unofficial sources of benefits 멪 an occasional, pleasant surprise to incentivize your people and crank up their enthusiasm.

Extract from the original text:
몮Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of your men. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of turning the circuitous into the direct. Such is the art of armed struggle.몯

Analysis:
몮Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night.몯 Be like dark clouds covering up the sky, so that the sun, moon and stars become invisible, and their movements impossible to measure.

몮When you move, fall like a thunderbolt.몯

Lord Jiang Ziya said: 몮Be like thunder that comes so quickly that there is no time to cover your ears; be like the lightning that strikes before you can blink your eyes.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮This is about attacking as if striking from the empty sky above, so that the enemy does not know how to evade you.몯

몮Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.몯 

When the sky is filled with dark clouds, nobody can see the sun, moon or stars, and your enemy cannot tell which cloud harbors thunder and lightning behind it. Behind the cloud layer, the hunter몭s eyes look down from on high, unseen yet seeing all. When a lightning bolt suddenly cleaves the sky, there is nowhere to hide, and no time to react.

몮When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men.몯


To put this line simply, it몭s about sharing the wealth, so that everyone gets a piece of the pie.
몬Plundering a countryside몭 means robbing local landowners, but also the common people of your enemy몭s country. Once your army arrives in the enemy몭s lands, you move through the villages, plundering as you go. What kinds of things do you take? You might take grain and other food, other useful items or tools, livestock such as chickens, ducks, pigs, sheep, cows and horses, and you might also take children, women, silk and gold.
Food and other resources are things that every army needs, and indeed, Sun Tzu writes about this specifically in Waging War: 몮Hence a wise general makes a point of obtaining food from the enemy. One zhong of the enemy몭s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one몭s own, and likewise a single picul of his fodder is equivalent to twenty from one몭s own store.몯 As for captured children, women, gold and silk, these are to be divided among the officers and troops, with everyone getting a share of the wealth, slaves and women.

몮Let the spoil be divided amongst your men.몯

This just means that everything should be shared, so that every man in the army has the chance to get his hands on something. There몭s no risk involved in plundering villages, and it can bring in lucrative profits. This cushy job shouldn몭t be given to just one unit; it몭s important that every man in your army gets the chance to join in. Everyone can get rich together!
Plundering was an unwritten convention of ancient warfare. It몭s certainly one of the uglier parts of army life, but it was an important incentive mechanism.
Whenever you hear about disciplined, well-behaved armies that leave the common people alone, this is because there몭s some higher political ambition driving them. They already consider the common folk of the enemy몭s country to be their own compatriots; they need to be looked after, and made ready to become future subjects of their new lord. But when a war is a simple conflict between two states, with the only aim being to extract some benefit from the enemy, there몭s no need to treat the enemy몭s people nicely, and they become just another part of the spoils of war, to be divided up between the officers and common soldiers. It몭s similar to the Chinese Communist Party몭s early 몬mass struggle movements몭 against landlords in the 1950s. If you were a landlord, you essentially had a big label on your face saying 몬class enemy,몭 and that meant you몭d be swept away as if you were dust, with absolutely no mercy. Then, all the villagers, having just overthrown the local landlords, would take part in claiming the 몬spoils of war.몭 Every family got to take home part of the wealth. One effect of this was that, even if you only took an old iron cooking pot, you몭d become a part of the Communist revolution.
For over 2,000 years, China and the Xiongnu people from the north fought each other. When the northerners ventured down into China for a new round of war, plundering was their only goal. From the perspective of a Xiongnu leader, the warriors riding with you are following you because they want plunder, and you need to make sure that opportunities to plunder, as well as the actual spoils of war, are distributed in fair and rational way. Otherwise, your band of warriors will start fighting one another, and your army will collapse in on itself. Generation after generation of successful generals who lived through times of war had one thing in common: they were all extremely fair in the way they divided up the spoils of war.
But, how do you actually put fairness into practice? It몭s not at all easy, because people are prone to believe that they haven몭t been treated fairly, even if it몭s not true. If everyone thinks they몭re getting shortchanged, then, essentially, 몬fairness몭 doesn몭t even exist. One general had a solution 멪 he would not take a single bit of the spoils of war for himself. He decided he would only take what the Emperor saw fit to give him, and leave everything that came from the battlefield to be divided up among the soldiers. That way, nobody could complain to him.
War can be divided into two different types. The first can be called 몬invasions,몭 which are characterized by plundering. The second can be called 몬campaigns,몭 examples of which include the Chinese Nationalists몭 Northern Expedition (1926-1928 CE), and Zhuge Liang몭s nine campaigns into China몭s Central Plain region.
The goal behind 몬invasions몭 is to gain some kind of benefit, like plunder and territory. Invasions aren몭t meant to bring down and replace the enemy state; they몭re simply about plundering and seizing some advantage, or perhaps beating the enemy into submission so that they have to sue for peace. That naturally involves them paying you, in the form of ritualized tribute offerings.
몬Campaigns몭 are quite different. They몭re built around political objectives. In Chinese, the word for 몬campaign몭 멪 which can also be a verb meaning 몬to campaign against somebody몭 멪 has a root meaning of 몬to chop down trees.몭 During a military campaign, you chop down the trees outside the enemy몭s temples, ancestral shrines and graveyards. Once all the trees are down, you level the buildings, overthrow the enemy state and take your place as ruler of all the land. So, 몬campaigns몭 are about cutting down the enemy몭s power, their culture and their symbols. Then, you build up your own power system, and your own symbols. During China몭s Cultural Revolution (1966-1976 CE), the Confucian temples were destroyed. Even if you몭ve already gained power, you still have to keep on cutting down the old powers.
As the cycle of warfare and chaos came full circle, time and again throughout history, bandits and thieves roamed the land, and feudal lords fought each other for supremacy. The way to identify a leader who has grander ambitions 멪 for instance, someone who dreams of ruling the entire known world 멪 is to watch out for armies that don몭t plunder, and that leave the common people undisturbed. One example would be Li Zicheng, a rebel leader who launched his bid for supremacy during the final years of the Ming dynasty, and who called himself 몬The Roaming King.몭 He was known for his slogan: 몬The Roaming King isn몭t here to take your grain!몭 He successfully captured Beijing, but then he fell back into his old ways 멪 he forgot that he was in Beijing on a military campaign, and not as an invader. He took the local children, women and valuables, and shared them with his soldiers. This paved the way for Wu Sangui, the general who helped establish the Qing dynasty, to lead Manchu soldiers through the mountains and toward Beijing from the northeast.
Let몭s talk some more about 몬plundering the countryside, and dividing the spoils amongst the men.몭 Cao Cao wrote a comment on this line, but it몭s quite vague: 몮Find a way to victory based on the enemy몭s situation.몯 Cao Cao isn몭t really saying anything here. Bearing in mind that he was a leader of soldiers and also a prime minister, it몭s likely that he didn몭t want people to hear him talking about these things.
By contrast, Du You몭s comment is very specific: 몮If the enemy몭s villages and towns are undefended and their livestock and wealth easily available to plunder, then this plunder must be divided in an orderly manner, so that every member of your forces obtains some part of it. You must not allocate everything to one recipient. Thus, everyone, from the young to the old, the weak to the strong, will want to participate in war and gain some advantage for themselves.몯 It몭s important to make sure that everyone gets opportunities, and that no single army unit keeps all of the loot. If you can do this, everyone will be enthusiastic.
When Zeng Guofan spoke about the art of being a good general, he emphasized that it몭s important for generals to be incorruptible. Ordinary soldiers might not understand the finer points of military strategy, but they can all understand where the money is. If the general is greedy for money, or if he몭s cutting his men out of the spoils and keeping them all for himself, his soldiers will never willingly give up their lives for him. But, if you몭re uncorrupt and clean, and make sure you have something nice to give your troops every now and then, every one of your men will gladly follow you and kill your enemies.
We몭re now getting to the part about 몬unofficial welfare benefits.몭 Any organization is always going to need some kind of benefits. The problem with official benefits is that people feel they몭re entitled to them, and as soon as they begin taking them for granted, the benefits몭 incentive mechanism breaks down or even goes into reverse, encouraging laziness. So, you몭re always going to need a few unofficial sources of benefits 멪 an occasional, pleasant surprise to incentivize your people and crank up their enthusiasm, as well as to keep things interesting for them.

몮When you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of your men.몯

The meaning of this line is basically the same as: 몮When you plunder a countryside, let the spoils be divided amongst your men.몯 The difference is that the 몬spoils of war몭 are for sharing with the common soldiers, while new territory is to be divided up among the senior generals, especially those who몭ve made a big contribution to the war effort. It몭s essentially about giving out land and noble titles. Cao Cao comments: 몮This is about sharing benefits gained from the enemy.몯

몮Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮This is about gauging the enemy몭s situation before engaging in plunder.몯
The Wei Liaozi said this: 몮Ponder the enemy and evaluate your generals before taking action.몯
In the original Chinese text, the idea of 몬ponder몭 is expressed with the image of hanging up a steelyard weight, part of an ancient scale used for weighing objects. Zhang Yu comments: 몮Weigh the enemy so that you know how light or heavy he is, evaluate your generals몭 ability or lack thereof, and then determine to take action.몯

몮He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of turning the circuitous into the direct. Such is the art of armed struggle.몯

After you몭ve worked out whether the enemy is a heavyweight or a lightweight, and where his weak and strong points are, consider the terrain and then plan out how to apply the stratagem of 몬turning the circuitous into the direct.몭 Within this is another principle: in armed struggle, strive to position yourself ahead of your enemy.


The command system makes the army

It doesn몭t matter how many soldiers you have in your army 멪 if you don몭t have a command system, it몭s not an army. It몭s just a swirling mass of blind men. That몭s why the saying goes, 몬A general in the field might not hear all of his king몭s orders,몭 and not 몬A general in the field might not obey all of his commander몭s battle orders.몭 Any army officer who defied orders from his superiors would soon find his body separated from his head.

Extract from the original text:
몮The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the gathered army may be focused on one particular point. The army thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.몯

Analysis:
The Book of Army Management was an ancient Chinese military text, but it is now lost to history.
Part of what is known about it today, from instances where it was quoted in other writings, is a passage that reads: 몮At times it is not possible to hear one another몭s voices. That is why we have drums and gongs. At times it is not possible to see one another; that is why we have flags and banners.몯 
Gongs and drums serve as an alternative command system. Ancient gongs were made of bronze, which produced a resonant, percussive sound like 몬DANG,몭 powerful enough to send vibrations through people몭s bodies. Ancient war drums were made from cowhide, and emitted an energizing, blood-pumping 몬DONG몭 sound. In their simplest usage, drumbeats were the signal to attack, while the gong was used to signal retreat. But, there were also many other signals, and many other instruments, such as bugles and horns, each used to send different kinds of information.
In situations where soldiers and officers couldn몭t see one another, flags were used to relay commands. Many different colors and patterns were used, each with a different role in communicating. There was also a whole system of 몬flag language,몭 with different movements and gestures used to convey various kinds of information about battle commands or the enemy몭s situation. Flags were a visual communication tool; a way of using signals to give commands.


몮Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the gathered army may be focused on one particular point. The army thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men.몯

If you have gongs, drums and signal flags, you can make your entire army see and hear the same thing at the same time, and move as a single, coordinated unit. The bravest among your warriors can몭t charge the enemy on their own if you haven몭t ordered them to, and the less brave among your men can몭t retreat unless you give the order. This is how to command a large army in battle.
Under strict military discipline, 몬Any man who, upon being ordered to advance, does not advance, or who, upon being ordered to retreat, does not retreat, shall be executed.몭 There is a story relating to this from the ancient commander Wuzi몭s war against the state of Qin. As the two armies stood facing one another, before the fighting had begun, one soldier couldn몭t contain his fighting spirit, and charged the enemy on his own. He killed two enemy soldiers, cut off their heads, and took them back to his comrades. Wuzi executed that man. One of Wuzi몭s officers had his own opinion about this, which he expressed to the commander: 몮That man clearly is a person of considerable ability! Why not give him a chance to make up for his crime?몯 But Wuzi replied: 몮Military discipline is not concerned with distinctions between men of ability and men without ability.몯
A general in the field might not hear all of his king몭s orders, but it is absolutely unacceptable for anyone to ignore commands given on the battlefield. That is how serious battle commands are. So, suppose you몭re an officer leading a battle unit in a pursuit movement. Judging from the situation in front of you, you몭re only moments away from catching the enemy, but then you hear the sound of gongs from behind. In this moment, you absolutely have to retreat, even if it means letting the enemy get away. This is because it몭s not your job to give commands 멪 you don몭t know what the overall situation is across all parts of the battlefield.

몮In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.몯

There몭s a story from the Spring and Autumn period that몭s well known by Chinese readers. It involves Cao Gui, a general from the state of Lu who is famous for his theoretical approach during the battle of Changshao, a conflict between the neighboring states of Lu and Qi. After a round of fighting between the two armies, the Qi army was second best, and began to retreat. Duke Zhuang of Lu wanted to pursue the fleeing enemy, but Cao Gui urged him to wait. Cao clambered up onto a chariot and spent some time surveying the scene. Eventually, he said that now was a good time to pursue, and so that몭s exactly what the Lu troops did. They chased the enemy for 30 li, killing as they went. After it was all over, Duke Zhuang asked Cao Gui what his reasoning had been. Cao Gui said that although the enemy seemed to be defeated and retreating, he was concerned that they might have laid an ambush. But, then he saw that the enemy chariots were moving chaotically, and that the enemy flags had fallen on the ground. That was how he knew it was safe to start chasing them.
What does it mean if the enemy battle flags have fallen? It means that they no longer have a command system, and that their soldiers are all fleeing for their lives. It몭s become an 몬every man for himself몭 scenario. At this point, you could say that the enemy army is no longer an army; it몭s turned into a torrent of blind men. So, it몭s safe to give chase.
Of course, it몭s also possible to be tricked even when the enemy몭s flags are in a mess. You might think that their command system has broken down, but it몭s possible that they몭re using gongs and drums to send secret signals, and that abandoning their flags was all part of their plan to trick you.
In Du Mu몭s comment on this passage, he talks about how fires and drums were used in army camps during nighttime: 몮When the army has halted, they are used to set camp; when the army is marching, they are used to set formation.몯 The logic behind setting up camp in the evening is more or less the same as that behind marching during the day. When marching, within the formation of the army as a whole, you need to organize men in smaller units of ranks and columns. Likewise, a large army camp is made up of many smaller 몬sub-camps.몭 The different parts of the army 멪 forward, rear, left and right 멪 set their tents in concentric circles. The commander-in-chief몭s encampment is located in the dead center of the camp, encircled by the other camps, which together formed an interlocking and symmetrical pattern, a bit like star constellations in the night sky. Each of the small camps would be positioned between 50 and 100 paces apart, with pathways connecting them. The space between these camps would be large enough for the army to easily exit the camp and form up in battle formation. The camps were also close enough to each other that if one camp was attacked, soldiers in the neighboring camp could help their comrades by shooting at the enemy from behind their camp몭s fortifications. In each place where two pathways intersect, a raised earthwork would be built 멪 with firewood laid on top and trenches dug underneath 멪 where soldiers would be stationed to keep watch.
If the enemy tried to raid the camp during the night, the watchmen would wait for them to enter the camp, and then sound the drums. Soldiers from each of the camps would respond at the same time, lighting all the prepared firewood and turning the night as light as day. Soldiers were not allowed to run about on their own, but had to line up in battle formation, forming walls blocking the enemy몭s exit. That way, it would be clear that any men left running around in a disorderly fashion were enemy soldiers. Then, archers would climb up to high positions and shoot the enemy soldiers until there were none left standing. Any invader venturing inside the camp would never leave alive.
This is exactly how Zhuge Liang planned his camps: they were like nets set out to trap the enemy. When he finally retreated, abandoning his camp, Sima Yi went to see what he could learn from his enemy몭s camp design, and apparently sighed: 몮Genius! This truly is a wonder of the world.몯


Energy and momentum determine victory; You should have the awareness to guard your energy, and you should have strategies for cultivating energy

Extract from the original text:
몮A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.몯

Analysis:
몮A whole army may be robbed of its spirit.몯 This is about attacking the morale of the enemy troops, so that all their energy and momentum turns into sluggish dejection. When an army loses morale, it also loses its strength, and so its battle capability goes out the window, too.
The American psychologist David Myers put forward a 몬fatigue motivation theory몭 that can be used to explain issues about the connection between troop morale and battle capability. According to his theory, the human body몭s energy store is a constant, but people allocate themselves different amounts of energy each day, based on their needs and their level of motivation. If their motivation is strong, they allocate more energy. Conversely, if they have a low level of motivation, they allocate a smaller amount of energy.
The most famous historical example of an army being robbed of its 몬spirit몭 is one we just mentioned, in which Cao Gui explained his methods to his lord at the battle of Changshao, fought between the states of Lu and Qi. As the two armies faced off, the Qi drums began beating, and Duke Zhuang of Lu immediately became eager to get the fighting started. But Cao Gui raised his voice: 몮Not yet!몯 He held the army몭s battle lines in an iron grip, and let it be known that anyone who broke formation would be executed. The Qi army charged the Lu battle lines, but when they were unable to break through, they retreated, re-gathered their flags and drums, and then came again. But still, the Lu army wouldn몭t charge. After three rounds of drumming by the Qi drummers, the Lu army finally began beating their own drums, and charged the enemy, thoroughly beating them. Later, when Duke Lu asked Cao Gui to explain his reasoning, Cao Gui said: 몮Any kind of fighting always involves courage. The first round of drumming builds up soldiers몭 energy; in the second round, the enemy begins to deflate; and in the third round, the soldiers enter a state of rest. I make sure that when the enemy is resting, my energy is in full flow; that is why I can defeat my enemy.몯 
After one round of drumming, the Qi soldiers were pumped up and ready to go, but the Lu army ignored them and refused to engage. After three rounds of drumming, the Qi soldiers couldn몭t keep their excitement going 멪 they lost their energy. Meanwhile, the Lu soldiers had conserved their energy, and now they were ready to unleash it. This is how you engineer a situation where the enemy is resting, while you몭re overflowing with energy.
There몭s another, similar historical example, from the final years of the Three Kingdoms period, involving Sima Yi몭s son, Sima Shi.
A Wei general named Wen Xin had rebelled against the state, so Sima Shi took an army to deal with him. Wen Xin put his son, Wen Yang, in charge of his whole army, even though Wen Yang was just 18 years old. Wen Yang told his father: 몮The enemy army has to travel a very long way to come here. I몭m going to hit them as soon as they arrive, before they have the chance to get settled. That몭s how we can beat them.몯 The boy몭s father didn몭t say anything, so when the two armies were lined up facing one another, Wen Yang got the drums beating. Amid deafening noise, the men shouted, 몮Let몭s kill the enemy!몯 But three rounds of drumming went by, and still Wen Xin didn몭t give the order. Wen Yang was forced to retreat east, along with his father.
When Sima Shi saw the enemy retreating, he said: 몮Wen Xin몭s going to run! Quick, chase him!몯 But his officers replied: 몮Wen Yang몭s a fierce commander 멪 if he몭s running away before the fight몭s even begun, it might mean he몭s laid an ambush for us.몯 But Sima Shi had the last say: 몮After the first round of drumming, the energy peaks, after the second round it begins to diminish, and after the third round it is depleted. Wen Yang beat his drum three times, but Wen Xin didn몭t respond. Wen Yang몭s men will now have no energy left, so what are we waiting for?몯
The Wei army gave chase, and dealt a major defeat to Wen Xin.


When a leader has inner power, their team몭s energy and momentum are unstoppable

몮A commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.몯

Analysis:
Du Mu comments: 몮The heart 멪 it is upon the general몭s heart that the entire army relies.몯 It might not matter much if one soldier in an army is a coward, but a general몭s cowardice can infect the whole army. 몬Robbing a general몭s presence of mind몭 means probing at and undermining the enemy general몭s resolve, because if he loses his resolve his army will fall apart.
Our historical example for this subchapter is one we discussed in Chapter Three, about attacking and sabotaging the enemy몭s plans. It몭s the story of Kou Xun몭s campaign against Kui Xiao, during the time of the Eastern Han dynasty. One of Kui Xiao몭s senior generals, Gao Jun, who was in charge of holding a certain city, sent one of his officers, Huang Puwen, to visit Kou Xun as an emissary. However, when Huang Puwen refused to submit to Kou Xun or to pay his respects, Kou Xun immediately had him executed, and then sent Huang Puwen몭s deputy back to Gao Jun to tell him to surrender. The next day, Gao Jun opened the gates of his city and surrendered.
Kou Xun몭s officers asked him to explain how this had happened. Kou Xun replied: 몮Huang Puwen was the brains of Gao Jun몭s whole operation; it was he who did Gao Jun몭s planning and strategizing. When he came here, he was unyielding and defiant 멪 it was clear that he could not be convinced to surrender. If I had let him go back to Gao Jun, his planning abilities would have been put to work for Gao Jun. But, by killing him, I could rob Gao Jun of his courage and make him surrender.몯
So, by executing a single man, Huang Puwen, Kou Xun was attacking Gao Jun몭s planning capabilities. A commander can be robbed of his presence of mind 멪 in this case, killing the one man Gao Jun relied on was enough to rob him of his presence of mind.
For our second historical example, we turn to the Uprising of the Five Barbarian Peoples during the Sixteen Kingdoms period (304-439 CE). Specifically, let몭s look at the war between Tuoba Gui of Northern Wei and Murong Bao of the Later Yan. As their two armies faced one another across a river, Tuoba Gui received intelligence that Murong Bao몭s father, Emperor Murong Chui, had fallen ill at around the time that Murong Bao had deployed his forces. So, Tuoba Gui cut off the Later Yan army몭s communication lines, so they would be unable to receive news from home. Later, Tuoba Gui몭s forces captured a Former Yan messenger, and forced him to shout across the river to Murong Bao: 몮Your father is dead. You need to go home, now!몯 When Murong Bao heard this, he was overcome with worry and snuck out with his forces under the cover of night, heading homeward. Tuoba Gui chased him, and defeated the Later Yan army at the Battle of Canhe Slope.
Sima Fa wrote: 몮The mind is set in an original state, but it can be defeated after an influx of new energy.몯
Duke Li of Wei wrote: 몮In attack, one must not only attack the enemy몭s fortifications and battle lines; it is essential to possess the skill to attack his mind.몯
If you want to rob someone of his presence of mind, there몭s a precondition몯 you need to have inner mental power. For a leader to be able to build up his team몭s energy, he must have the ability to strengthen his own mind. When the leader몭s mind is strong, his team becomes truly powerful, like a force of nature.


Force makes for a long war; Energy brings victory

Force can몭t last for long, which is why it몭s impossible to have a constantly overflowing supply of energy. It몭s important to be constantly aware of your energy and how to tend to it, and to know how to tend to your team몭s energy. As for whether it몭s possible to influence other people몭s energy멞 since we몭re not in a war, it몭s best to focus on ourselves. There몭s no point to occupying your thoughts with other people when you haven몭t yet taken care of yourself.

Extract from the original text:
몮Now a soldier몭s spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.몯

Analysis:
몮Now a soldier몭s spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.몯
In simple terms, morning is the best time to get things done. Morning is the time when mental energy is at its fullest; by noon, it begins to decline, and by evening all you몭re thinking about is heading home for the day.
There몭s a passage in The Methods of Sima that reads: 몮New energy defeats old energy.몯
Chen Hao comments: 몮When new energy first arrives, it is full and sharp; do not fight someone in this state.몯 When the enemy is flush with new energy, stay out of his way, and don몭t try to fight him. Let him stew for a while.
Meng Shi comments: 몮Morning energy is the energy of beginnings; noon energy is the energy of continuing work; evening energy is the energy of decline.몯 The meaning is the same as 몮The first round of drumming builds up the energy, with the second round of drumming the energy begins to deflate, and with the third round, the energy is depleted.몯
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Morning 멪 here he speaks of beginnings; noon 멪 here he speaks of the midpoint; evening 멪 here he speaks of endings. He says that one몭s energy is sharp in the beginning, but after a while one몭s energy declines and one몭s thoughts turn to returning home. This is the time when one may attack.몯 The reason why it몭s important to pursue the enemy when they are withdrawing is because the enemy soldiers are all thinking about going home. This means that they don몭t have the will to fight, and the time is ripe to wipe them out.
So, in fact, the ideas of 몬morning, noon and evening몭 used here don몭t correspond directly with the specific times of day that they seem to refer to, but represent a progression of three stages.

몮A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.몯

Skilled generals stay well out of the enemy몭s way while they몭re still in the first flush of sharp, hard-edged energy, and wait for them to lose their edge, and for their thoughts to turn to home. That몭s when the skilled general attacks. This is the way to manipulate energy.
In the aftermath of the collapse of the Sui dynasty (581-618 CE), among three main contenders vying for the throne, it was Li Shimin who would eventually triumph and become the first Emperor of the Tang dynasty, Emperor Taizong. During his struggle for supremacy, he went on the warpath against another contender, Wang Shichong. This was a worrying development for the other contender, a general named Dou Jiande, because if Wang Shichong fell, the delicate equilibrium between the three of them would break down. So, Dou Jiande moved out with a large army to help Wang Shichong fight Li Shimin. He lined his soldiers up along the eastern bank of the Si River, and his army was so large that it stretched for miles. A powerful energy hummed through the ranks. From a nearby mountainside, Li Shimin looked down at the enemy. Turning to his officers, he said: 몮The traitor army is poised and dangerous, but they have no government giving them instructions. We will keep our lines close to the city walls 멪 this will put my heart at ease. We will hold our position, and we will not go out to meet the enemy, but wait for enough time to pass that their soldiers grow tired and hungry. Then, they are sure to withdraw. As soon as they withdraw, we will move out and pursue them, and then we shall be able to defeat them in a single battle.몯
Dou Jiande kept his troops in formation from six o몭clock in the morning until noon. They became tired and hungry, and some of them sat down on the ground, while others took breaks to drink water. Li Shimin saw this, and shouted: 몮Now is the time to strike!몯 The two sides fought a battle, and by the end, Dou Jiande was Li Shimin몭s prisoner.
In chains, Dou Jiande was brought before Li Shimin. The victorious Li asked his prisoner: 몮Originally, I set out to fight Wang Shichong. There was no need for you to be involved 멪 it had nothing to do with you 멪 so why did you travel so far to be here today?몯
몮I thought I몭d deliver myself right to your door, and save you the trouble of making a long trip just to come get me.몯 As soon as these words came out of Dou Jiande몭s mouth, any residual angry energy disappeared.
몮Force makes for a long war; energy brings victory.몯 Force can몭t be kept up for long, which means it몭s impossible for your energy stores to always be full. Properly managing your energy 멪 maintaining the sharp, powerful energy of the morning 멪 is the key, for both individual people and for teams.
We need to keep observing our teammates and ourselves. When we first set out on a new endeavor, we don몭t let our standards slip, and each of us puts our full energy into our work. This is the meaning of 몬morning energy몭 or 몬sharp energy.몭
After working like this for 10-20 years, we have no more financial pressure to deal with, or at least, much less. We have a family, and now it몭s time to enjoy life. Once you reach this point, it몭s possible that you might not have the awareness or the ability to take the next step upward. If you can몭t find new value for yourself, and a new way of expressing that value, you won몭t be able to transition upward to the next stage, and you몭ll find yourself confronted with sluggish, lazy energy.
If this lazy energy keeps growing, it will turn into 몬evening energy,몭 and you break down as a person until you effectively become waste for the trash heap.
We need to keep reflecting on ourselves, keep our energy sharp at all times, hold on to our true, individual nature and fulfill our life duties. Once we reach the point where we have less energy than we did in our youth, we have to focus our 몬sharp energy,몭 stay committed to our position on the front line, and stay connected to the earth몭s energy. We must also begin to transition upward to the next stage, moving from working on our own self-realization to helping other people become who they are meant to be.
It몭s necessary to have a constant awareness of managing energy 멪 not only your own, personal energy, but also the energy of your team. As for whether it몭s possible to influence other people몭s energy, since we몭re not in a war, it몭s best to focus on ourselves. There몭s no point occupying your thoughts with other people when you haven몭t yet taken care of yourself.	


Managing your own mind 멪 The root of everything

Extract from the original text:
몮Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy: this is the art of retaining self-possession. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well fed while the enemy is famished: this is the art of husbanding one몭s strength. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array: this is the art of managing changes.몯

Analysis:
몮Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy: this is the art of retaining self-possession.몯
Use your discipline and orderliness to wait for the enemy to fall into chaos. Use your calm to wait for the enemy to become agitated and loud. This is how to manage your mind.
Du Mu comments: 몮Sima Fa Said, 몬The mind is set in an original state.몭 Understanding the enemy is the way to win. Although your mind may be already set in a certain state, you can make adjustments and manage it, making yourself calm, sturdy and immune to annoyances and temptations. Wait for the enemy to descend into disorder and confusion, and then send out troops to strike him.몯
What exactly does Du Mu mean by the words 몬disorder몭 and 몬confusion?몭 Chen Hao comments: 몮Disorder is when the government gives contradictory commands and there is no clarity in the system of rewards and punishments. Confusion is when the flags are jumbled and troops make much noise and act recklessly while on the march. If you detect these things in your enemy, then it is time to move your forces and strike.몯
He Shi comments: 몮Every general stands alone, in body and in mind, and alone, must take a great, confused array of things deep into his mind: uniting hundreds of thousands of troops, standing against ferocious, pitiless enemies; making sense of a tangle of dangers and potential advantages, untying victory from defeat, keeping track of the many, minute variations in power and knowledge. He must take these things inside himself without becoming lost within their vast spaces; he must allow no trace of disorder into his heart. How can he make himself endlessly adaptable to changing situations? How can he not get lost in details while dealing with all manner of things? How can he maintain composure when suddenly faced with a great disaster? How can he maintain a clear mind while dealing with everything? Self-management is all that is needed to deal with confusion. Even if a million enemy soldiers are arrayed before you, if you see them properly, then it will be no different to facing a small raiding force. When Yafu encountered a raiding party, he obstinately refused to get up from bed; When Luan Cuan was about to go to battle, he used orderliness and leisure to good effect. If we are to evaluate these two cases, what stratagems did they use? They are refined in the way that they conceal their wisdom, and they nurture their minds with the result that they have an abundance of wisdom.몯
This is brilliant commentary by He Shi. As a general, every move you make has an impact on huge amounts of wealth, human lives, perceptions of truth, ethics and the moral fiber of many people. A leader몭s emotions have an impact on the morale of the entire organization, and they can interfere with the leader몭s decision-making and execution of plans. So many decisions are made because of pressure and anxiety. This kind of decision, which often is rash and ill advised, is an attempt to find some relief from the pressure and anxiety. Either that, or it몭s a result of the leader몭s inability to 몬maintain composure when suddenly faced with a great disaster.몭 When confronted with challenging and dangerous circumstances, they panic and lose all sense of the right way forward, and instead gallop off in the worst possible direction, towards certain doom.
몮When Yafu encountered a raiding party, he obstinately refused to get up from bed.몯 One night, while Zhou Yafu was dealing with the Rebellion of the Seven States, there was a sudden commotion in his camp, and he could hear chaos outside his tent 멪 soldiers shouting and screaming. So, what did he do about it? He stayed in bed, and went back to sleep. Eventually, the soldiers calmed down.
There are four key points to grasp if you want to keep your team몭s battle capability at a high level: managing energy, managing minds, managing strength and managing changes. And, at the root of all of this is managing your own mind.

몮To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished: this is the art of husbanding one몭s strength.몯

Be the first to arrive at the battlefield, and wait while the enemy makes a long slog from afar to reach your location. While you relax and wait, taking your ease, the enemy wears himself out marching at speed towards you.  And, keep your belly full while the enemy goes hungry. These are all ways to 몬manage strength몭 and to maintain battle capability.
The reason Li Shimin held his troops in position and waited all morning, while Dou Jiande몭s troops stood in formation, ready for battle, was to force the enemy to lose its orderliness, freshness and calm, and fall into chaos, noise and exhaustion. At the beginning of the morning their bellies were full and they were not thirsty, but by the end of the morning their bellies were hungry and their throats were parched, and they몭d used up the strength that they needed to be properly prepared for battle.
Duke Li of Wei stated that all of the thousands of pages written about The Art of War boil down to a single idea: 몬Manipulate your foe, and do not allow yourself to be manipulated.몭 In other words, seize the initiative and keep it firmly in your grasp. 

몮To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array: this is the art of managing changes.몯


Cao Cao comments: 몮The meaning of 몬in calm and confident array몭 is that the enemy몭s army is very large.몯
Here, 몬intercepting몭 means 몬attacking.몭
If the enemy몭s flags are neat and well ordered, and if their battle lines are powerful and imposing, then don몭t attack. Do some evasive maneuvering, and let the enemy use up some of their energy. Wait until their 몬sharp morning energy몭 has run out; wait until they몭re hungry, thirsty and have lost their excitement, and become full of 몬lazy midday energy몭 and 몬time-to-go-home evening energy.몭  Then it is time for you to attack.
Once, while Cao Cao was besieging the city of Yecheng, a general named Yuan Shang made an attempt to break the siege from outside. Cao Cao said: 몮If he comes here along the main road, we should evade him. But if he comes from around the mountains to the west, he will soon be our prisoner.몯 What was Cao Cao몭s reasoning? Basically, if Yuan Shang advanced along the main road, his army would be able to move 몬in perfect order몭 and in 몬calm and confident array.몭 They would be fearless, and it would not be possible for Cao Cao to beat them. There would have to be some significant change in circumstances in order for Cao Cao to prevail. But, if Yuan Shang chose the difficult path along the base of the mountains, his men would have to walk carefully, with eyes glued to the ground. They몭d have a feeling of being unsure, and they wouldn몭t have much physical strength to call upon. They would be easy targets.
As it turned out, Yuan Shang did choose to advance around the western mountains, so Cao Cao wheeled his forces around, attacked him on the road and heavily defeated him.
몬Managing changes몭 is a skill that몭s used to respond flexibly and effectively to developments in the enemy몭s circumstances. Even though Cao Cao was an extremely formidable general, he didn몭t take the threat posed by Yuan Shang lightly. If Yuan Shang had arrived in 몬perfect order,몭 Cao Cao was prepared to run and stay well clear of his enemy몭s claws[bd20]. The Book of Army Management contains a passage that reads: 몮Advance when you see that it is possible to do so, retreat when you become aware of difficulty, and avoid the enemy when he is strong.몯


You need policies, strategies, tactics and a toolbox of elementary battle tactics

Extract from the original text:
몮It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard. Such is the art of warfare.몯

Analysis:
In my opinion, the most accurate way to break down the topic of military strategy is to use the six-level approach created by 19th century Swiss military strategist Antoine-Henri Jomini. His framework can be neatly applied to any strategic endeavor, no matter what it might be, and used to bring a high degree of clarity into your planning.
The first thing to think about is policy. Jomini put policy ahead of strategy, and he believed he was the first military strategist to propose that policy should be put above strategy. What this means in a military context is that the first thing you need to get busy with is foreign policy and diplomacy. Only after this step do you move on to decisions about whether or not to fight, who to build alliances with, and who to fight against.
In a business operations context, the first thing to do is formulate policies governing how we interact with society and with consumers. Only when this is taken care of should we move on to thinking about what we need to do in terms of strategy. What the word 몬policy몭 means is: 1) Who am I? 2) Whose interests do I represent? 3) What basic policy direction do I have to inform my actions?
Sun Tzu talks about policy, too. What he calls 몬The Way몭 (one of the 몬Five Factors and Seven Considerations몭) is just another way of saying 몬policy.몭
What exactly is the difference between 몬policy몭 and 몬strategy?몭 Strategy is about yourself; it몭s your personal scheme. Policy is about other people; it comprises the practices[bd21] you use with other people. Putting policy before strategy means that you think about other people, and then you think about yourself. First, think about the interests of all interested parties, and the systems and setups of the various players in the game.
After policy, we move on to item two: strategy.
Strategy is about: 1) Where you are now; 2) Where you want to go: 2) How you get there. Strategy is your roadmap to victory. Sun Tzu몭s approach to strategy is to win first and fight later, or to force the enemy몭s army into submission without fighting. This is what strategy is made of.
The third level in Jomini몭s framework is 몬overarching tactics.몭 This is about using one trademark move, something that only you can do, and capitalizing on it in any kind of situation. This is a common trait of every successful person 멪 they all have their own, personal, special skill. This is what 몬overarching tactics몭 is all about.
In Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, the primary battle tactic is to use your main force to start a battle, and an auxiliary force to win it. This is applied to any and every battle situation; no matter how you fight, it몭s always some variation of the art of division. Main and auxiliary forces repeatedly switch roles, with infinite variability.
The fourth of Jomini몭s six levels is 몬military logistics.몭 This is a key topic in Chapter Two of The Art of War 멪 Waging War 멪 and it includes all kinds of details. They include things like how to 몬field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand sets of armor, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand li.몭 No matter how strong or massive an army may be, without guaranteed logistical support it will be extremely vulnerable, fragile and likely to shatter upon first impact.
The fifth of Jomini몭s six levels is the art of engineering, which is about how to attack and defend fortified strongholds.
Finally, the sixth level is basic tactics, which is all about how to fight in various situations. In other words, it몭s a tactical toolbox, a term commonly used in Chinese and one that몭s often cited in employee training programs. 
In this chapter of The Art of War 멪 Armed Struggle 멪 Sun Tzu writes: 몮It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.몯
Here, we are entering the realm of basic tactical principles.


The art of war can몭t account for all possible situations 멪 That몭s what makes it so deadly!

Extract from the original text:
몮It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard. Such is the art of warfare.몯

Analysis:
몮멞 not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.몯
When the enemy holds the high ground, you can몭t attack. If the enemy is coming down from a mountain or a hill, you can몭t counterattack.
If you do choose to attack an enemy who is uphill from you, the terrain is against you. It will be hard for you to leverage your strength, and it몭ll be easy for the enemy to launch missiles, such as logs and boulders, down at you.
If the enemy holds the high ground and charges downhill at you, the terrain is working to his advantage. He doesn몭t have to worry about covering his rear, and it몭s so easy for him to build momentum as he moves from high ground to low that his strength is effectively doubled. Don몭t try to counterattack. Instead, try to draw him onto level ground, and fight him there.
Our historical example for this subchapter is another one that we looked at earlier in the book: Zhao She몭s war against the Qin forces. Zhao She set up camp fifty li short of the city he was aiming to save. One of his men, Xu Li, advised him to take up a position on the mountains to the north, because, as he said: 몮Victory will belong to whoever holds the northern mountains.몯 So, that몭s what the Zhao army did: they turned the terrain to their advantage. When the Qin forces arrived, they struggled to scale the mountain but were unable to reach the top. Then, the Zhao army hit the Qin soldiers with their full force, inflicting a heavy defeat on them.
Zhuge Liang once said: 몮When fighting in steep country, do not attack a position that is higher than your own. If the enemy comes towards you from a higher position, do not try to fight them, for the momentum will be against you. Instead, draw the enemy onto level ground, and only then engage.몯
However, there몭s always another side to things. Zhuge Liang famously had to execute his disgraced ally, Ma Su, after the Battle of Jieting. Ma Su had occupied the high ground and set up camp on top of a mountain, where he could await the enemy Wei army. He positioned himself 몮looking down at the enemy,몯 the story goes, 몮with the intention to cut through the enemy like an axe through bamboo, to put himself in death몭s way and yet prevail.몯

It must be noted that while the semi-fictional classic novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, holds that Zhuge Liang executed Ma Su, official historical records say Ma Su died in prison. There몭s also a theory that Ma Su never reported back after his defeat, and escaped into obscurity with his life.
Ma Su몭s deputy general, Wang Ping, had tried to persuade Ma Su not to set up camp on the mountain, reasoning that there was no water source up there and no resupply route. If the enemy surrounded the mountain, he몭d be stuck up there and unable to get out alive.
Why was Ma Su unable to understand the logic of what Wang Ping was trying to tell him? The truth is that he did understand, but his whole plan was to put himself in a dangerous position and yet find a way to survive. He wanted to occupy the high ground and slam down into the Wei army with overwhelming force. He몭d never planned to stay on the mountain for any length of time, so as far as he was concerned, issues like water sources and resupply routes were completely irrelevant.
However, Ma Su forgot one thing. Back when Han Xin had put himself in a similarly dangerous situation, with his back to a river, and yet found a way to survive, he didn몭t put all of his men by the river. He kept 2,000 cavalry aside, and it was this cavalry force that captured the Zhao camp and activated the 몬main force/auxiliary force몭 synergy. If Han Xin hadn몭t used the art of division and separated his army into main and auxiliary forces, and instead positioned his entire army by the river, things would have been very different. He and his men would have ended up in a watery grave.
But, Ma Su didn몭t use the art of division. Instead, he placed all of his soldiers and horses in death몭s doorway.
Wang Ping was unable to talk Ma Su around. All he got for his efforts was a tongue-lashing from Ma Su, who called him an 몬unlettered general몭 who had 몬no understanding of the art of war.몭 Wang Ping was in fact illiterate 멪 he knew no more than ten Chinese characters 멪 while Ma Su was a talented literary man. So, naturally, Ma Su had nothing but contempt for his deputy. Wang Ping decided to try a different approach. He suggested that Ma Su set up camp on the mountaintop, but give some of his men to him, so he could set up another camp on level ground and divide their forces into two prongs. And then, if either of them got into trouble, the other could come to the rescue. Ma Su agreed to this.
So, in the end, the army did use the art of division: Ma Su led the main force, and Wang Ping led the auxiliary force.
When the Wei commander, Zhang He, arrived, he saw that Ma Su was encamped on the mountaintop, so the first thing that he did was surround the mountain. The second thing he did was cut off the water source and resupply routes. Ma Su had expected this to happen 멪 he wasn몭t Zhuge Liang몭s favorite student for nothing. But, he didn몭t expect the third thing that Zhang He did, because it몭s not written about in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War. Zhang He set fire to the mountain.
What makes The Art of War so dangerous is that it can몭t cover every base; it can몭t account for every possible real-world situation.
As soon as the fire started to climb up the mountain, the words 몬Do not advance uphill against the enemy몭 no longer applied. Ma Su몭s men, already unbearably hungry and thirsty, fell into chaos as the smoke and heat of the fire began to torment them. In that state, there was no way they could charge down toward the enemy below them. Zhang He launched an attack, and Ma Su was badly beaten. After losing Jieting, Zhuge Liang몭s whole war plan was completely derailed.
But what about Wang Ping몭s auxiliary force? Wang Ping just stood and watched. There몭s a biography of Wang Ping, in the historical text Records of the Three Kingdoms, that contains the following passage: 몮Ma Su turned away from the water source and went up the mountain, a disastrous decision. Wang Ping repeatedly tried to reason with Ma Su, but Ma Su did not take his advice, and suffered a heavy defeat at Jieting. Ma Su몭s soldiers scattered, but Wang Ping, at the head of a thousand men, sounded his drums, and Zhang He did not press him, for he suspected an ambush.몯 
Wang Ping몭s fortunes began to improve after the Battle of Jieting, and he went on to become a highly respected general in the Shu army.


Use yourself as bait; this is the only way to snare your enemy

Extract from the original text:
몮It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard. Such is the art of warfare.몯

Analysis:
몮Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight.몯 Another line 멪 몮Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy몯 멪 also has this meaning: when the enemy uses bait, don몭t bite on his hook. 
Send a small force uphill to attack the enemy, and then have them pretend to retreat. The idea is to draw the enemy몭s entire army toward you, and then hit him with your auxiliary force, crushing him in one fell swoop. This is a standard tactic 멪 it몭s nothing new for anyone who wasn몭t born yesterday.
And yet, once you몭re actually on a battlefield and the enemy몭s retreating, it몭s impossible to judge with any certainty whether it몭s a real retreat or a fake. You see the bait, but you can몭t tell if there몭s a hook hidden within. It몭s precisely because of this kind of conundrum that we have the expression 몬armchair strategist몭 to describe someone who seem to know everything, and yet never manages to make the right judgment calls. The truth is, these people don몭t really know what they몭re talking about.
So, does the fact that we몭ve read Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War mean that we know the concepts of 몬Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight몭 and 몬Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy?몭 The answer is: no, we don몭t know. But, if we know that we don몭t know, reading The Art of War hasn몭t been totally in vain. 
These two tactics 멪 simulating flight and offering bait 멪 were the key to Han Xin몭s defeat of the Zhao army at that famous battle in which he began with his back to the river.
Han Xin몭s first move was to deploy 10,000 troops in a battle line by the riverbank, and then he sent out a detachment of soldiers as bait, to get the fight started. And who played the role of the bait? Han Xin himself. That몭s why the Zhao army couldn몭t help but bite! How could they not, when they saw Han Xin dangling right in front of them, there for the taking? They certainly weren몭t going to go for any other target.
Because it몭s nearly impossible to turn down such tempting bait, there are many more examples throughout history of using commanders-in-chief, and even Emperors, as bait. When the prize is so great, the enemy is sure to bite, even if he knows you몭re baiting him. And, once the enemy gets excited, it몭s even more of a done deal 멪 he몭s definitely not going to hold back and think about whether or not he몭s being baited. However, this is the kind of tactic that only gets put on the planning table if the commander himself puts it forward as an idea. Advisors would never normally dare to suggest that their boss should use himself as bait.
When Han Xin marched forth at the head of his unit of bait soldiers with drums pounding and his personal banner streaming in the wind, excitement crackled through the Zhao ranks. They all knew that a big battle was coming, and that whichever one of them cut off Han Xin몭s head would instantly become a great hero. Today was going to be their day!
Han Xin몭s men and the Zhao troops smashed together in combat, and after a while, Han Xin started his 몬simulated flight.몭 But, in fact, it wasn몭t an entirely false retreat. He didn몭t have much choice but to withdraw, because the Zhao forces had a huge numbers advantage over him, and he could never have beaten them if the fight kept on going the way it had started. So, the genius of his mock retreat was the fact that it was actually very real. He couldn몭t win, and that made his fake withdrawal all the more convincing.
As Han Xin retreated, he started to lay out his baited hooks: his personal banner, his ceremonial weapons, his war drums, and so on. All of these items would be highly valuable to the Zhao troops; whoever got hold of Han Xin몭s personal banner would be sure to receive rich rewards. And so, the entire Zhao army poured out of the gates of their camp, falling over themselves in their rush to grab the treasure and bite on Han Xin몭s hook.
The Zhao army broke two of Sun Tzu몭s rules: 몬Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight몭 and 몬Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy.몭 Meanwhile, in front of the massed Zhao soldiers, Han Xin몭s unit retreated to the riverbank, joined forces with the 10,000 men he몭d stationed there earlier, and then charged back towards the Zhao army. From behind the Zhao lines, Han Xin몭s 2,000-strong auxiliary cavalry force rode into the Zhao camp and captured it, leaving the Zhao army facing a powerful enemy to their front, and suddenly without a base to retreat to. That was the moment when they crumbled.
There몭s a common Chinese saying: 몬You can몭t expect to catch the wolf if you몭re not prepared to risk the life of your child.몭 From Han Xin몭s story, we learn that if you really want to catch the wolf, you also have to be prepared to use yourself as bait.


Analysis of the battle of Changping: In our own lives, we often play the roles of Zhao Kuo and the King of Zhao

Extract from the original text:
몮It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard. Such is the art of warfare.몯

Analysis:
In the most horrific conflict of the entire Warring States period, the Battle of Changping, 400,000 Zhao soldiers were buried alive. Why? Because the famous armchair strategist Zhao Kuo broke two important rules: 몮Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight몯 and 몮Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy.몯 Two other rules also played a part: 몮Do not advance uphill against the enemy and do not oppose him when he comes downhill.몯
As for the Qin commander, Bai Qi, he also broke three rules: 몮Do not interfere with an army that is returning home. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard.몯 If the enemy is forced into a corner, he몭s likely to fight with everything he has, so don몭t press too close. But, Bai Qi didn몭t pay any mind to these principles. He completely surrounded the Zhao forces and annihilated them.
Let몭s look at how the battle unfolded. The Qin army sent out a detachment of troops to act as bait, and then pretended to withdraw in defeat. Zhao Kuo immediately chased after them with his entire army. The Qin men drew Zhao Kuo to the main Qin force몭s position at a place called Changbi, where they Qin army was waiting for them.  The Qin commander was using principles from The Art of War: 몮Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will be exhausted,몯 as well as 몮Knowing the time and place of the battle몯 and 몮By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord.몯 The Qin generals knew that the outcome of the battle would be decided at Changbi, so that몭s where they set themselves up to lure Zhao Kuo to them. Zhao Kuo was completely in the dark about this.

몮The Regular May Be Used for Joining Battle, but The irregular Will Be Needed in Order to Secure Victory.몯


The Qin army started the battle by using its 몬bait troops몭 as their main (regular) force, while the main army stationed at Changbi served as the auxiliary (irregular) force.
When Zhao Kuo arrived at Changbi, the Qin bait troops merged with the bulk of the Qin army, forming a new main force. Now it was time for the Qin general to dispatch his second auxiliary force.
Zhao Kuo found his way forward blocked at Changbi, and the fighting wasn몭t going his way. He was getting ready to retreat when 25,000 Qin auxiliary troops struck out of nowhere. They had been waiting in ambush on each flank of the Zhao army, and now they cut their way behind the Zhao troops and took up a strong position on a raised barrier to the west. From there, they blocked the Zhao army몭s escape route and cut off Zhao Kuo몭s communications with his main camp. The Zhao army had now been split in two.
Next, General Bai Qi sent 5,000 elite cavalry soldiers to the Zhao camp, to pin down the small Zhao force that had been left behind to guard it. Now, all of the Zhao food resupply routes were cut off, and the Zhao army was completely immobilized.
Surrounded, Zhao Kuo몭s only option was to build defensive fortifications and wait to be rescued. Bai Qi didn몭t give him a moment몭s rest, sending out a constant stream of light cavalry to attack and harass him. Bai Qi was putting one of Sun Tzu몭s principles into action: 몮If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with food, he can starve him out.몯
When King Zhaoxiang of Qin received reports that Bai Qi had control of the situation, he immediately set out to the front lines, where he enlisted all local boys and men over the age of 15 into the Qin army. He then poured the new recruits onto the battlefield, completely surrounding the Zhao army and cutting it off from its resupply routes and from any would-be rescuers.
After 46 days without food supplies, the Zhao troops had become so desperate that they몭d started murdering and eating each other. All that Zhao Kuo could do was make one, desperate roll of the dice: he tried to break out of the Qin encirclement. He was killed in the attempt. His army surrendered, and then the Qin forces buried them alive 멪 all 400,000 of them.
The first question is: Why did Zhao Kuo make such a basic error? After all, he was quite familiar with all of the writings about the art of war. The answer is that he was too self-confident.
Newborn calves aren몭t scared of tigers, but that doesn몭t mean a tiger won몭t eat them.
Zhao Kuo몭s thinking would have gone something like this: 몬Lian Po (the previous Zhao commander-in-chief) is an old man, and now it몭s my turn to be my country몭s star general. Lian Po spent three whole years right next to the Qin army at Changping, and all he did was twiddle his thumbs and waste the country몭s resources. He몭s nearly bankrupted the state of Zhao, and now it몭s up to me to solve the problems he몭s created.몭
Since Zhao Kuo was so self-confident, it was inevitable that he would underestimate the enemy. In his first taste of battle with the Qin, his self-confidence was immediately validated when the enemy turned and fled. This proved to him that he was right, and that he was strong, so he immediately gave chase. While we might say the enemy was 몬simulating flight,몭 he would have argued that he was pressing his advantage and 몬attacking the enemy when they are sluggish and inclined to return home.몭 But, once he was committed to the chase, there was no turning back.
The second question is: How did Zhao Kuo몭s father, Zhao She, know that his son wasn몭t up to the task, and yet was unable to trip him up or stump him in debates about the art of war?
Zhao She once said to Zhao Kuo몭s mother: 몮War is a matter of life and death, and yet Kuo speaks of it so easily and lightly. If the king does not make Kuo a general, nothing will come of it, but if he is made a general, he is sure to be the ruin of the Zhao army.몯몯
Some say that Zhao Kuo was an example of someone who was deeply familiar with the scholarship on the art of war, but was unable to bring his knowledge into the real world. However, this misses the point. The essence of Zhao Kuo몭s problem was that just because someone has read all of the books on the art of war and is deeply familiar with them, that isn몭t the same as actually understanding the art of war.  
There몭s a saying in Chinese: 몬Even if you몭ve never eaten pork, you몭ve seen a pig running, haven몭t you?몭 This means that even if you몭ve never tasted their flesh, you still have some observational knowledge of pigs. But this is completely untrue! Seeing a pig running isn몭t the same as knowing about pigs. To really know what pigs are like, you have to have personally experienced eating pork. This is even truer in the case of Zhao Kuo. He몭d only ever seen pigs running through the pages of a book, and had never seen a real-life pig running in the real world!
So, when we read about principles, we only can say we know the principles; we can몭t say we can actually use them. To gain true knowledge, it몭s essential to actually use principles, and to practice using them.  As for how well you can know something, that몭s a different matter. There몭s no end to knowledge.
Confucius wrote: 몮Is it not a delight to learn something and have the time to practice it?몯 When we 몬learn몭 something, we haven몭t actually gained true knowledge of it. For that, we have to use this knowledge, practice it, and learn from experience. This is the only way to gain true knowledge, and it truly is a delightful thing!
Have you ever been taught something, yet failed to really learn it? Maybe you understood what your teacher was telling you, but when you actually tried to put it into practice, you found that you were unable to. That means you never really understood in the first place. You can only say you몭ve made some small steps in learning something once you몭re able to act on what you have learned.
Zhao Kuo몭s mother also knew that her son wasn몭t fit for the task he몭d been given. We know this partly because her husband, Zhao She, had told her as much, and partly because she tried to talk the King of Zhao out of appointing Zhao Kuo as commander. She said to the King: 몮You once appointed Kuo몭s father, She, as general. From the day that She received his orders, he never gave any attention to our personal family problems, and whatever gold or silks he acquired, he shared all of it between his officers and soldiers. Now, you have appointed Kuo as commander. You have given him rewards and noble titles, and he has kept all of this wealth in our family; he is storing it away, and he has told all of our family members to hurry and buy up the best land and houses. He does not behave in the way a leader should.몯
The third question is: Why didn몭t the King of Zhao listen? Why was he so hell-bent on replacing Commander Lian Po, and why did he want Zhao Kuo to take over? Did he really fall for the Qin trick 멪 몬the stratagem of sowing discord?몭 Qin spies had spread a rumor that the reason Lian Po wasn몭t attacking the Qin was because he planned to surrender, and that the Qin generals were much more afraid of Zhao Kuo than of Lian Po. So, did the King of Zhao fall for it?
Not in the slightest!
The reason why the King of Zhao made such a bad decision was because of anxiety and pressure. He was anxious and despondent, and he felt under such great pressure that he simply had to change something. Even if he was going to die, he had to at least go out fighting!
But why?
Let몭s take a look at how this war started.
It began when the state of Qin attacked the state of Han. The Qin army was too strong for the Han forces to deal with, so they sued for peace, and offered some land to the Qin if they would call off their attack. That land was the Commandery of Shangdang. But the Han official in command of Shangdang Commandery, Feng Ting, wasn몭t willing to take orders from the Qin authorities, so he decided to make his own offer. He announced that he was bequeathing Shangdang Commandery to the King of Zhao. The King of Zhao, being greedy by nature, was delighted, and immediately sent soldiers to occupy Shangdang. You could describe this move as 몬stealing food from the tiger몭s mouth.몭
There was no way the King of Qin would sit idly by after the King of Zhao had stolen his new land from under his nose, and he turned the Qin war machine toward Shangdang. Of course, the small detachment of Zhao soldiers sent to take possession of Shangdang was no match for the Qin army. They retreated to Changping. The King of Zhao then sent a large army to Changping, with Lian Po in command. The two armies faced each other from across the River Dan. Lian Po knew that he couldn몭t beat the Qin army, so he established a defensive position in favourable terrain, and dug in. He had no intention to get into a fight, and this situation lasted for three years.
Over the course of those three years, more than a million Qin and Zhao soldiers twiddled their thumbs at Changping, using up their countries몭 resources until both states were on their knees, their economies close to collapse. What started with the King of Zhao salivating over the prospect of getting his hands on some new territory ended up with his whole kingdom sliding towards collapse, before he몭d even had the chance to so much as sit down in Shangdang Commandery. There was absolutely no way he could leave his kingdom in this downward spiral. In Chinese there몭s a saying: 몬Trying to steal a chicken only to lose the rice you were using as bait.몭 But in this case, the state of Zhao was losing the entire contents of all of its granaries!
But would things work out if the King of Zhao tried to put an end to this descent into ruin?
In the end, he wasn몭t equal to the task.
The King of Zhao몭s frustration with Lian Po had reached boiling point 멪 he absolutely had to change something, anything! What he didn몭t realize was that making changes isn몭t the same thing as solving a problem, or that making the wrong change can even make the situation worse. As far as the King of Zhao was concerned, if Lian Po couldn몭t fight, it went without saying that none of the other old generals would be able to, either. The only option was to choose a younger commander. He realized that many believed Zhao Kuo wasn몭t the right man for the job, but also that nobody else could do what had to be done. Zhao Kuo hadn몭t yet been tested in battle, so why not take a chance and bet on him?
In our own lives, we go about most of our decision-making in more or less the same way that the King of Zhao did. We always feel a strong desire to solve problems, but we don몭t have the insight or attention span to realize that the action we choose to solve the problem is actually creating new problems, and might even bring a catastrophe down on our heads.
Imagine if we were sent back in time 2,000 years 멪 if we were in the King of Zhao몭s position, what would be the right thing to do?


A 몬fierce general몭 is one who hides when the enemy is fierce. They wait until the enemy has used up their strength, and then they unleash their ferocity

Extract from the original text:
몮It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard. Such is the art of warfare.몯

Analysis:
몮Do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.몯
The word 몬keen몭 means the same thing as 몬sharp,몭 as in 몬sharp morning energy.몭 You need to stay out of the way of the enemy when their energy is keen, and strike when their energy is lazy, and they몭re preoccupied with thoughts of returning home. When the enemy is full of energy and at the height of his powers, stay well out of his way. Let him stew for a while, and wait until his energy and excitement pass and he becomes hungry, thirsty and tired. Then, it몭s time to strike.
Once again, it몭s all about managing energy.
The management of energy was a strong suit of Li Shimin, who became Taizong, second Emperor of the Tang dynasty. We몭ve already learned about how Li Shimin beat Dou Jiande: during that war, he used the principles of 몬Do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen몭 and 몬Attack when the enemy is sluggish and inclined to return.몭 Now, we몭re going to look at two more historical examples in which Li Shimin plays the leading role.
In the first example 멪 Li Shimin몭s fight against Liu Wuzhou 멪 he used the same two principles.
Originally, Liu Wuzhou was a general in the imperial army of the Sui dynasty. When the Sui dynasty collapsed and the country descended into chaos, he raised his own army in rebellion against the Sui court, declared himself Emperor and went on the warpath. After securing support from non-Chinese Turkic forces, he seemed unstoppable. He fought several battles against the Tang forces, winning each time. He shredded Tang Prince Li Yuanji몭s forces, which fled in tatters, abandoning the city of Jinyang (Taiyuan) to the enemy. At this point, Li Xiao (first Emperor of Tang) and his group of allies lost their base to enemy forces; all the land east of the Yellow River was now under the control of Liu Wuzhou.
Li Xiao was running scared. He told his advisors: 몮It is impossible to contend with these bandits when their energy is like this. We should abandon the lands east of the Yellow River to him, and concentrate on guarding the lands west of the pass.몯 Li Shimin replied: 몮Taiyuan is the foundation of the King몭s entire cause; it is the very route of the country. The lands to the east of the Yellow River are rich, and it is from these lands that the capital derives its resources. Your humble advisor would hate for us to abandon these lands.몯 Then, Li Shimin asked for permission to personally lead 30,000 elite troops to deal with Liu Wuzhou and regain control of Taiyuan.
These were the events that led to the Battle of Baibi.
Li Shimin, taking advantage of thick ice on the Yellow River, crossed the river at the head of an army and arrived at Baibi. There, he confronted a detachment of Liu Wuzhou몭s army, under the command of General Song Jingang. Li Shimin and Li Daozong climbed up to a vantage point and looked down at the two armies. Li Shimin asked Li Daozong: 몮The enemy has so many soldiers 멪 what do you think will happen if they accept our challenge and come at us in force?몯
Li Daozong replied: 몮The bandits command an unstoppable force. It will be easy to make them submit using calculated strategy, but impossible to best them in a contest of strength.몯
몮My thoughts exactly,몯 Li Shimin said. 몮Song Jingang몭s army is seriously isolated; he has elite troops and ferocious generals under his command, and they are all gathered here. Liu Wuzhou is relying upon Song Jingang to hold us back so that he can retain control of Taiyuan, but Song몭s army lacks provisions. They rely on plundering to obtain the supplies they need, which means that it is to their advantage to finish this war quickly. I will close the gates of our camp and build up our energy until it is sharp enough to force back the enemy. Then, I will divide our army and send one part to strike the enemy in their belly. By that time, they will have used up their food supplies and exhausted their planning capabilities, and so they will naturally flee from our assault. This is the opportunity we should wait for; it would not be to our advantage to fight this war quickly.몯
몮Do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.몯 At that moment, Song Jingang몭s energy had reached its pinnacle 멪 it was as sharp as it would ever be. So, Li Shimin left him to stew. He waited for five long months, never venturing outside the walls of his camp, except to send small detachments to harass the enemy and disrupt their resupply routes. Eventually, Song Jingang ran out of food and lost the sharp energy that had made him so dangerous before. All he could do was withdraw.
As soon as Song Jingang withdrew, Li Shimin sprung into action, 몬attacking when the enemy is sluggish and inclined to return.몭 In ferocious pursuit, he and his army covered 200 li in a single day and night, fighting eight separate running battles as they went. After three days in which the Tang troops never once ate or took off their armor, the Tang generals finally called off the pursuit, announcing, 몮That will do.몯 They let their troops rest for a while, and once everyone had been fed and re-gathered, they set off once more in pursuit. Li Shimin said: 몮I planned this all out long ago: we will keep chasing and keep fighting, and by the time it몭s over, we몭ll have crippled the enemy for good!몯 The Tang forces kept up their pursuit, eventually pinning down Song Jingang몭s main force and annihilating them in a single fight. 
Liu Wuzhou, seeing that the tide had turned against him, abandoned Taiyuan and fled toward the lands of his Turkic allies. Before long, the Turks murdered him. And that is how Liu Zhouwu lost his power.
It was the same story when Li Shimin led a campaign against another rebellious warlord, Xue Rengao.
Xue Rengao had over 100,000 troops in his service, and they were full of energy, sharp and dangerous. Li Shimin used the same move he몭d used before, once again following the principle of 몬Do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.몭 After Li몭s generals begged him to allow them to attack the enemy, Li gave them a formal order: 몮Any man who dares speak of attacking shall be executed!몯 The two armies faced off for over 60 days, at which point Xue Rengao ran out of food. With no food, some of his men surrendered. It was clear to them that the other side몭s men got three square meals a day, while their own side had nothing left to eat.
When Li Shimin saw that the enemy had lost its sharp energy, and had come adrift from its purpose, he announced: 몮Now is the time to attack.몯
First, he sent out a small detachment to act as bait. Having lured out the few remaining enemy soldiers who still had the will to fight, his next move was to pour cold water over what was left of their sharp energy.
Li Shimin allocated part of his army to travel to Qianshuiyuan and set up camp there, under the command of General Liang Shi. Two months passed in which, try as they might, Xue Rengao몭s forces could not pull Li Shimin into a battle. One of Xue Rengao몭s generals, Zong Luohou, who was known to be a ferocious warrior, arrogant and always spoiling for a fight, couldn몭t take it anymore. He몭d reached breaking point. Zong moved out with his toughest soldiers and launched a blistering attack on Liang Shi. But, Liang Shi stayed safely behind his walls, content to let Zong wear himself out. Zong몭s response to Liang몭s refusal to engage was to redouble the intensity of his attack.
Li Shimin waited until Zong Luohou몭s energy was dulled and his stamina exhausted, and then personally led the bulk of his army onto the battlefield, delivering a crushing defeat to Zong. As Zong Luohou began to retreat, Li Shimin pursued him mercilessly, all the way to the foot of Xue Rengao몭s walls. Once there, he re-gathered his forces and surrounded Xue몭s position. Xue Rengaao, his nerves badly rattled, opened his gates and surrendered. Li Shimin took him prisoner and had him sent under armed guard to the capital city, Chang몭an, where he was executed.
The final years of the Sui dynasty were marked by the appearance of many heroic warriors, such as Li Mi, Dou Jiande and Liu Wuzhou. Each of them was a giant among men, but they were unfortunately up against a truly once-in-a-millennium fighter, a general so powerful that he was considered almost superhuman. That general was Li Shimin, and he wiped the floor with them.
What made Li Shimin such a great fighter was chiefly his ability to know when it was the wrong time to fight. His greatest power was knowing when to stay out of the way and hide. Then, once the enemy was drained of energy, he would unleash his power. He never had to fight more than one battle in a campaign 멪 he sealed the deal in the first round, and he always did a clean job. Everyone who fought against him was out-calculated, and wiped out.

Analysis:
몮Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy.몯
When the enemy lays out bait for you, don몭t bite.
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Fish die when they are greedy for bait; armies are defeated when they are hungry for bait. If the enemy uses soldiers to hook me, I must not follow them.몯
Our historical example for this subchapter is the story of how Cao Cao baited Liu Bei and Wen Chou.
Cao Cao was fighting a war against Yuan Shao. After executing Yan Liang and breaking the Siege of Baima, he and several hundred cavalry troops were escorting heavy grain wagons as they withdrew from the front line. He was still on the road when he ran into several thousand enemy soldiers led by Liu Bei and Wen Chou, who had been chasing him. Cao Cao몭s generals were shaken and scared. The way they saw it, the enemy had too many soldiers for them to fight, and their best option was to run back to the safety of their camp. Cao Cao몭s advisor, Xun You, said: 몮This is a situation in which we should bait the enemy. What should we do to drive them away?몯 They decided to abandon the heavy grain carts, while also unsaddling the horses and setting them free. This was a trick; a way of tempting Yuan Shao몭s troops. The plan worked 멪 Liu Bei and Wen Chou both went straight for the grain carts, and Yuan Shao몭s troops busied themselves stealing whatever they could. Fighting was the last thing on their minds. Then, Cao Cao and his men mounted their war horses, charged their distracted enemies and killed Wen Chou.
Du Mu provides a completely different commentary. According to him, the words 몬Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy몭 should be understood literally. In his interpretation, it means that you shouldn몭t eat any food that the enemy leaves behind because it might be poisoned. 몮If the enemy, being in a rush, leaves food behind after leaving a place, the food must first be tested and not eaten directly, for concern that it may have been poisoned.몯
Du Mu follows these words with a historical example.
During the reign of Emperor Wen of the Later Wei period (Cao Cao몭s second son), the imperial lands were raided frequently by the nomadic Kumo Xi people from the north. Emperor Wen ordered the King of Jiyin, Tuoba Xincheng, to take an army and deal with the Kumo Xi raiders. Tuoba Xincheng had his men collect a large number of wine jugs, which he filled with poisoned wine and deposited around his camp. When the enemy attacked, he pretended to think he was no match for them, and fled from his camp. When the enemy troops entered Tuoba Xincheng몭s deserted camp, they were delighted to find so much wine, and drank without restraint, happy for the chance to let their hair down. As the poison started to take effect, Tuoba Xincheng appeared out of nowhere, and this time it was he who was on the offensive. With no effort at all, he defeated the enemy, taking thousands of prisoners.
Was Du Mu몭s assertion about poisoning correct? Of course not. There몭s no way that Sun Tzu몭s original intention for this line was to remind us not to eat candy from strangers. But, it doesn몭t really matter that Du Mu몭s comment is incorrect relative to Sun Tzu몭s original intent, because there is still some value to it. From him, we have learned that there are real historical cases of poisoned wine being used to win a war.
There몭s one exceedingly common mistake we make when we몭re studying or talking through problems: we몭re focused exclusively on winning. Instead of concentrating on what we can learn, or on new experiences we can have, we think only about beating other people. When you몭re debating with someone, they might have made a very eloquent and strong point, and yet you rack your brains to come up with a counterpoint, because you want to beat them. Or, approaching from a different angle, you might be looking for a way to put your fellow debater off balance 멪 that way, you can show off your own skill, or at least show other people that you know more.
In classroom situations, when we ask the teacher a question, it몭s not always because we really have a question.  Sometimes it몭s just a way of displaying our 몬wisdom.몭 When class is dismissed, or when we finish reading some famous book, we exchange our ideas about what we몭ve learned with other people, but this isn몭t necessarily about having an intellectual exchange. Perhaps it몭s really about saying things like, 몬Well, I think what they said there is obviously wrong.몭
Wanting only to win is a very serious problem that can derail a person몭s studies. It makes you aggressive towards your fellow students in discussions, it makes you want to challenge your teachers, and when you read ancient texts, it even makes you want to 몬beat몭 the ancient writers themselves! As soon as you become obsessed with winning, you can no longer study with any sincerity. Instead, you hold on tight to the pleasure you gain from correcting mistakes. What you몭re doing isn몭t studying at all; it몭s correcting mistakes.
I felt and saw this very clearly while I was reading Eleven Commentaries on Sun Tzu몭s Art of War, because this text is the product of 11 different people writing in different historical time periods, Each one built on the foundation left by those came before him. The first commentator was Cao Cao, so he became a target for the others. Mainly, it was Du Mu who attacked him 멪 he shot so many arrows at Cao Cao몭s commentary that it ended up like a porcupine. Many of Du Mu몭s comments begin with the line. 몮What Cao Cao wrote is mistaken.몯 Cao Cao was long dead by the time Du Mu was writing, and he couldn몭t rise from his grave to argue back, so these textual 몬debates몭 were, naturally, entirely one-sided. Du Mu always won. But why was Du Mu always saying that Cao Cao was wrong? It몭s because it gave him a huge amount of pleasure to feel he had beaten Cao Cao.
Du Mu was a literary man 멪 a poet 멪 meaning that he took special joy in being original and unconventional. It seems to me that Du Mu probably wasn몭t thinking much about what practical use The Art of War might have in his own life when he was writing his commentary. Instead, he was likely  much more preoccupied with his own writings. If his commentary was too similar to those written by previous commentators, he may have felt, it would be meaningless.
Confucius once said: 몮He who is respectful to others will not be treated with insolence.몯 The other side of this is: If you are disrespectful to others, you will be treated with insolence. Du Mu had a habit of claiming that other people were wrong, and so, naturally, other people came after him and said he was the one who was wrong. That몭s why, each time the line, 몮What Cao Cao wrote is mistaken,몯 appears in Eleven Commentaries on Sun Tzu몭s Art of War, it몭s immediately followed by 몮What Du Mu wrote is wrong.몯 Mei Yaochen, in particular, made it his business to set the record straight. Mei Yaochen lived during the Song dynasty, and like Du Mu, he was also a poet. Du Mu had been dead for 200 years by the time Mei Yaochen was writing, so he obviously couldn몭t argue back.
In the final analysis, who do we think is right?
First of all, we몭re not really concerned with who was right. Our main interest is what we can learn, and what use the text has in our own lives. Reading and studying is about projecting what we learn onto ourselves and our own experiences. It몭s about applying what we learn to real-life situations and using it to figure things out. That몭s what real studying is about. It몭s a terrible mistake to chase after being 몬original,몭 and doing things just so that you can push your own theories.
Second, just because something몭s wrong does not mean it has no value. We몭re able to learn a great deal of unusual things from Du Mu몭s commentary. Isn몭t that a good thing? Also, he put a huge amount of work into writing his observations, and that몭s why he became the greatest and most influential of the 11 commentators. There몭s no need for us to correct his mistakes; it몭s enough to take what we can from his work.
The Prussian military theorist, Carl von Clausewitz, once said: 몮No matter how absurd a mistaken opinion may be, it at the very least enables us to learn other people몭s way of seeing things.몯 There is value in this. Sometimes, when someone tries to explain their theory to you, it seems so ridiculous that you can몭t even deal with it. At times like this, you should try to find something positive 멪 this person is teaching you that there are people out there who see things in this way!
Third, who몭s really right? This question is, quite naturally, something we pay a lot of attention to. After all, there is such a thing as right and wrong. So, who몭s right? I pretty much always assume that Cao Cao몭s comments set the standard. Why? Because Cao Cao몭s the only one who몭s actually 몬eaten the pork!몭 The others haven몭t so much as seen a pig running.
Apart from Cao Cao몭s commentary, there몭s one other book that has been an authoritative mainstay for me: A Translation and Commentary of Sun Tzu몭s Art of War, by Guo Huaruo. Guo Huaruo was a Lieutenant General in the People몭s Liberation Army of China, a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy, and he taught for many years in the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University. His commentary is fit to be used as a standard go-to for any questions readers might have about The Art of War.
I often find myself in discussions with other people about Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, and  two questions often come up.
The first is whether Sun Tzu and Sun Bin were the same person. Nothing much can be said about this, other than that it몭s a boring question. There몭s no way they could have been the same person, because Sun Tzu worked with the King of Wu during the Spring and Autumn period, and much of the contents of The Art of War specifically talk about the state of Yue. Sun Bin lived in the state of Qi during the Warring States period, and by the time he was born, the state of Wu had long since fallen into history몭s dustbin. More than 100 years passed between Sun Tzu몭s death and Sun Bin몭s birth. The only reason there몭s debate about this is that some people want something to talk about, to show that they몭re cultured and knowledgeable. These people몭s theories aren몭t worth taking seriously 멪 they몭re only interested in empty talk, not in real learning.
The second point that몭s regularly questioned in discussions is the line: 몮Though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.몯 When you look at this line in the context of the text that comes before and after, its meaning is as clear as day. 몮It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy몭s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide the army12 into[bd22] two. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.몯
If you can win, go ahead and fight. If you can몭t win, then run. If you only have a 몬small force,몭 but you insist on being 몬obstinate몭멪 meaning that you refuse to run away 멪 you몭re going to be captured by the enemy. Or, at least, that몭s what everyone thinks it means. One prominent Chinese expert[bd23][TT24] who studies Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War who has a different interpretation of the original text. According to him, the real meaning of this line is: 몬If the weaker side is able to hold out obstinately, they몭re guaranteed to be able to capture their more powerful opponent, without killing him.몭 If that몭s really what Sun Tzu meant, there was no point in him saying the lines that came immediately before.
There is another interpretation, also from a highly regarded expert[bd25], that really takes the cake. So vast is his learning that he came up with a unique way of expressing his ideas. After all, if his writing were no different from other people몭s, his breathtaking scholarship would have no chance to shine. According to him, the word translated as 몬obstinate몭 actually means 몬the enemy몭s financial assets and equipment.몭 He argues that the line means: if you can beat the enemy, all his treasure and gear goes straight to you, regardless of how carefully he몭s locked it up and hidden it away! He then quotes a passage from the classic Daoist text, Zhuangzi, to prove his point: 몮Zhuangzi said: 몬If one would like to ensure that thieves come groping into your bags and rifling through your cupboards, and you want to make the right preparations, then you must lock up your things as tightly and securely as you can.몭몯
As soon as the distinguished professor몭s audience hears the Zhuangzi quotation, they몭re blown away: 몬Wow! You know everything!몭
As we contemplate the ills of education and academic pursuit, we might listen to what Wang Yangming wrote about it: 몮When there is already a fully adequate explanation for something, do not persist in constructing alternative theories to defeat the original one.몯 This isn몭t real learning. It몭s empty, and it몭s motivated only by a vain desire for victory.
When learning, just ask yourself what you몭re getting from it, and if it몭s useful to you. Don몭t pedantically quibble over words and manufacture farfetched connections, all in the belief that what you몭re doing is 몬scholarship.몭
This is why, during my studies of The Art of War, I try to understand it on another level 멪 I insert myself into what I read, and imagine what I would do if it was me. When we study, just like when we watch films, we naturally imagine ourselves on the winning side. We need to turn it around and imagine ourselves as the losing side, and think: 몬If it were me, what would I do about this situation?몭
Put yourself into the books you read, and then put the books you read into your own life and work. 
What has been revealed to me in my actual work, and what real-life situations have I been in that mirror scenarios and echo principles from Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War?
True learning comes when you diligently hone and polish what you have learned.


Managing energy is about weighing one몭s willpower and matching it against your opponent몭s

Extract from the original text:
몮Do not hem in an army that is returning home. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard. Such is the art of warfare.몯

Analysis:
The three instructions in the passages are about managing energy, and they all boil down to the principle of 몬not attacking soldiers whose temper is keen.몭

몮Do not hem in an army that is returning home.몯

When soldiers are on the homeward road, their minds are focused sharply on the fact that they몭re going home. If you get in their way, they몭ll fight you with everything they have.
But, weren몭t we just talking about how you should attack the enemy when their energy is sluggish? So, why aren몭t we supposed to 몬interfere with an army that is returning home?몭 This is a question of directions. If the enemy troops want to go home, and you몭re chasing them from behind 멪 and if they want nothing more than to get home as quickly as possible, and have no desire to fight you 멪 you몭re in a strong position to take advantage, in terms of energy.
However, if you몭re in front of the enemy, blocking their way home, they몭ll fight with everything they have. In that situation, their energy is stronger than yours.
Our historical example for this subchapter comes from Cao Cao몭s campaign against Zhang Xiu. The campaign wasn몭t going well for Cao Cao, and he decided to retreat. But Zhang Xiu몭s ally, Liu Biao, sent reinforcements and blocked Cao Cao몭s way home. Pressed in by enemies, in front and behind, Cao Cao set a trap. During the night, he stealthily moved out his heavy supply wagons and deployed troops in an ambush formation. Then, he waited for Zhang Xiu to come after him. The next day, Zhang Xiu came in hot pursuit and got caught in Cao Cao몭s ambush. With infantry and cavalry soldiers clamping him in a pincer from either side, Zhang Xiu suffered a major defeat. When the battle was over, Cao Cao said to an advisor, Xun Yu: 몮The bandits hemmed us in while we were returning home and gave me a situation of life and death; that is when I knew that victory was ours.몯
Du You comments: 몮If the enemy is wavering and is marching a great distance towards home, because of the perilous circumstances in which they march, each enemy soldier thinks only of returning home, and so the enemy army has the ability and the courage to fight even unto death. Be slow and watch for opportunities presented by the enemy; do not move great distances in order to intercept him.몯

몮When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.몯

When you surround an enemy, you have to leave a gap for him, so that he has a way out if he wants to run for his life.
There is a passage in The Methods of Sima that reads: 몮Surround him on three sides, leaving one side as an outlet. This is to show him a path to survival.몯
The intention here is to not corner the enemy in a deathtrap, which he has to fight his way out of alive, because in this scenario everyone dies fighting. The intention is to make him run away, and once he몭s running, to hit him with ambushes. Ideally, you would have troops lying in ambush at different points along the route that he몭ll take as he runs homeward. You let him run for a while, and take a bite out of him as he runs into the first ambush. Then, he runs some more, and runs straight into the next ambush 멪 and you take another bite. A few more bites like this, and you will have eaten and thoroughly digested every last part of him.
Turning back to Cao Cao몭s fight against Zhang Xiu, what is it that Zhang Xiu and Liu Biao should have done with their armies?
First of all, they shouldn몭t have completely surrounded Cao Cao, because they didn몭t have the ability to eat him. With no way out, and staring down death, every man in Cao Cao몭s armies fought for their lives 멪 they were unstoppable. Zhang and Liu should have let Cao Cao go, with Zhang Xiu chasing after him from behind, and Liu Biao waiting in ambush further down the road. But what Liu Biao actually did was attempt to hold a very dangerous position and block Cao Cao몭s way home. Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War tells us that we should surround our enemies if we have ten times his numbers. Liu Biao never had anything close to that kind of superiority.
If we recall, we몭ve already looked at this historical example, but from a different viewpoint. Just as Zhang Xiu was moving out to chase Cao Cao, one of his advisors, Jia Xu, told him that he mustn몭t chase Cao Cao unless he wanted certain defeat, because Cao Cao was bound to have set an ambush. Zhang Xiu didn몭t listen, ran straight into an ambush, and lost the battle. Upon his return, he asked Jia Xu: 몮Well, clearly you somehow know when I몭m bound to lose a battle, but can your abilities tell you when I몭m bound to win? It몭s not much use to me if you only know about losing. If I몭m going to win my battles, I need to know the results beforehand!몯 Jia Xu replied: 몮The time is now! Quick, go and give chase 멪 you are sure to win!몯 Zhang Xiu turned straight around, jumped on his horse and chased after Cao Cao once more. Just as Jia Xu had said, the next time he came back, he몭d just won a battle.
But why was that the case?
The first time that Zhang Xiu gave chase, he was 몬hemming in an army that is returning home.몭
But, the second time, he was 몬attacking when the enemy is sluggish and inclined to return.몭
The types of energy involved in these two scenarios are very different. The two sides몭 levels of determination had changed, and this in turn resulted in a major change to the fighting capacities of each side. 
Managing energy is about weighing up both sides몭 level of determination, and matching yours against theirs.

몮Do not press a desperate foe too hard.몯

Nothing fights harder than a cornered animal. If your enemy is already in a desperate situation, don몭t be too eager to get close to him. Don몭t press him so hard that he has nowhere left to run, because then he몭ll turn and fight to the death.
Somehow, at some point, the words 몬do not press a desperate foe too hard몭 morphed into 몬do not pursue a desperate foe.몭 But Sun Tzu never said that. 몬Do not press몭 and 몬do not chase몭 are two completely different things.
Of course you should chase them. Why wouldn몭t you?
Mao Zedong once said: 몮The general should ride the momentum of his courage and pursue the enemy when they are under pressure; the general should not vainly flatter himself and take after the example of past tyrants.몯


Appendix: Complete text of Armed Struggle

Sun Tzu said: 몮In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp. After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the circuitous into the direct, and misfortune into gain. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of the circuitous and of the direct. Armed struggle can be advantageous, and it can be dangerous. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, you will be too late. On the other hand, abandoning the army for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their armor, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred li in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination. If you march fifty li in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal. If you march thirty li with the same object, two thirds of your army will arrive. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of neighboring lords. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country 멪 its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and obstructions, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides. In war, make deception the foundation upon which to stand, move with advantage, and change by dividing and consolidating. Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the forest. In attacking and ravaging the enemy be like fire, in immovability like a mountain. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of your men. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of turning the circuitous into the direct. Such is the art of armed struggle. The Book of Army Management says: On the field of battle, the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the institution of banners and flags. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and eyes of the gathered army may be focused on one particular point. The army thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling large masses of men. In night fighting, then, make much use of signal fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of your army. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind. Now a soldier몭s spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy 멪 this is the art of retaining self-possession. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well fed while the enemy is famished 멪 this is the art of husbanding one몭s strength. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array 멪 this is the art of managing changes. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate foe too hard. Such is the art of warfare.몯


Chapter Eight
Variation in Tactics

Making progress means constantly discovering what you can몭t do

What does it mean to know how to do something? It몭s impossible to say. Only people who know how to do the thing in question know what it means to 몬know how to do it.몭 Not only that, as time passes they find again and again that they can몭t do it anymore. They have to progress some more, and they have to keep growing their skill.

Extract from the original text:
몮In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces. When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In a desperate position, you must fight. There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must not be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops. The general who does not understand these may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.몯

Analysis:
Variation in Tactics is the shortest chapter in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, at only just over 200 Chinese characters in the original text. However, the subject matter is complex 멪 it overlaps with content from other chapters, and the ordering and layout is a little chaotic. In particular, there몭s a part where Sun Tzu says, as a kind of summary, that if you don몭t know about the variations of tactics, no amount of knowledge about the terrain will enable you to actually take advantage of favourable terrain. This has prompted some researchers to say that this section should have been put at the end of Chapter Ten (Terrain). The suggestion is that once the reader is finished learning about terrain, they can be reminded that they have to know how to adapt to the situation at hand. There are also some related technical terms that only appear, with accompanying definitions, in Chapter Ten.
Anyway, while noting that some people might have something to say about this, let몭s stick to the order of the original text.
몬Variation몭 refers here to being able to adapt to changing circumstances, and being able to deal with a situation without relying on conventional principles. In the original text, the title of this chapter is actually Nine Variations. The Chinese tend to use numbers in a more general sense, so here, 몬nine몭 just means 몬many.몭 As such, Nine Variations could be translated as Several Types of Situations in which to Be Mindful of Adaptability.
However, Cao Cao clearly states that there are nine relevant situations in his commentary: 몮By considering the main variations, we derive nine principles to be used.몯 
This is awkward. We are presented with a circle to be squared. No matter which way you count it, there just aren몭t nine principles:
1. When in difficult country, do not encamp.
2. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies.
3. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions.
4. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem.
5. In a desperate position, you must fight.
6. There are roads that must not be followed.
7. There are armies that must be not attacked.
8. There are towns that must not be besieged.
9. There are positions that must not be contested.
10. There are commands of the sovereign that must not be obeyed.
And the grand total is멞 ten principles!
Which brings us to an explanation offered by certain scholars, which is that there are 몬nine variations and one summary.몭 According to them, the tenth and final principle is actually just a summary of what has come before.
There몭s a vast number of studies and research about The Art of War, full of stuff like this. I generally don몭t use, or even discuss, this kind of material. It몭s not particularly relevant for our study of Sun Tzu몭s thinking whether there are nine principles or ten, and once you start getting into this kind of highly detail-oriented research, it can easily consume your whole academic career. This kind of work is the specialty of scholars and experts, and it몭s outside the scope of our studies. Even if we studied it, it wouldn몭t improve our critical thinking.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮몬Variation몭 refers to being unconfined to ordinary methods; it is about adapting to situations as they arise. It is about resourcing our actions from that which must be done. Whenever one is competing for advantage with another person, one must know the nine variations. That is why this chapter follows after Armed Struggle.몯
If you don몭t understand the art of war, you can몭t fight battles. If you go about your tasks using the principles of the art of war, but you still lose, that몭s because you don몭t understand Variations in Tactics.
This is why it몭s impossible to say what it means to know how to do something. As we said, only[bd26] people who know how to do the thing in question know what it means to 몬know how to do it.몭 And as time goes by, they can몭t do it anymore. They have to exercise and advance their skill.
Making progress means constantly discovering what you can몭t do.


It몭s better to go looking for death than to wait for It to come to you; when you find yourself facing death, fight with steely determination

Extract from the original text:
몮When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In a desperate position, you must fight.몯

Analysis:
Cao Cao, in his commentary, defines 몬difficult country몭 as 몬places in which nothing can be relied upon; places of water and ruin.몭 What he몭s talking about is places dominated by water: wetlands, lakes, marshes and any other locale where the sodden terrain makes travel difficult. Don몭t camp in places like this. When there몭s water everywhere, not only is it difficult to actually set up camp, but if the enemy shows up, you몭ll have a hard time building defenses and you won몭t have much ability to quickly move around the camp.

몮In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies.몯

몬Country where high roads intersect몭 refers to wide-open terrain, where it몭s possible to move in any direction. The original word used in the Chinese text 멪 qu, a rarely used term meaning 몬thoroughfare몭 멪  appears in the name of a city in Zhejiang Province. The city is called Quzhou, and it was given this name because it몭s easy to travel from Quzhou to four different provinces: Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui and Jiangxi. This is the kind of place that military strategists fight over.
In ancient China, places where there is open country made it easy to travel between different feudal states. In these places, you need to 몬join hands with your allies.몭 In other words, make sure you get your foreign relations right. If you get that right, you몭ll get help from your allies. At the very least, make sure your neighbors don몭t see you as an enemy, and make sure they don몭t fall into enemy hands.

몮Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions.몯

Li Quan gives his definition of 몬dangerously isolated positions몭 in his commentary: 몮Dangerously isolated places are those in which there are no wells or natural water sources, no animals or livestock, and no firewood. One must not linger in such places.몯 
Jia Lin comments: 몮River canyons with dangerous waters and no through road 멪 this is what is called a dangerously isolated place; one should leave with haste, and must not linger.몯 If you find yourself in a dead end with dangerous terrain, get out of there quickly. Don몭t get boxed in by the enemy.

몮In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem.몯

We can find a definition of 몬hemmed-in situations몭 in Jia Lin몭s commentary: 몮When surrounded by danger on four sides, this is called a 몬hemmed-in situation.몭 The enemy is free to come and go, but I am unable to leave as I will. In this kind of situation, you may plan cunning stratagems to make the enemy unable to harm you; then, you can find salvation.몯
You face danger on all four sides, and the road ahead is narrow, while the road behind is tortuous and winding. It is easy for the enemy to travel here if he wants to, but it is difficult for me to come and go. Terrain like this is a 몬hemmed-in situation.몭 It몭s important to come up with a clever plan that makes it impossible for the enemy to hurt you. That몭s the only way to escape.
A good example of this is when Han Xin was about to deliver the final blow in the war against the state of Zhao. Before that, he had to get past Jingxing, a place with dangerous terrain, where it몭s easy to be hemmed in. With Jingxing, the clue is in the name. Jing means 몬well몭멪 as in 몬stuck at the bottom of a well몭 멪 and xing means 몬an area deep within a mountain range.몭 Han Xin took an extremely cautious approach, not daring to move his troops into Jingxing. Instead, he sent out spies, which gave him a clear picture of the situation. Only once he was sure there was no ambush did he swagger his way through the area, cross through the mountain pass and begin staging his famous show 멪 몬Han Xin fights with his back to the river.몭

 몮In a desperate position, you must fight.몯

After passing through terrain where he could easily have been hemmed in, Han Xin deployed his troops by the river 멪 a deathtrap 멪 and yet he came out alive.
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮When obstacles impede you in front and behind, the time has come to settle the battle in a death struggle.몯
He Shi comments: 몮He who quickly seeks battle will survive; he who dallies and does not fight will exhaust his energy, and meanwhile his grain supply lines are severed. Why wait for death?몯
When you몭re in a deathtrap, it really is true that it몭s better to go looking for death than to wait for it to come to you. When faced with death, greet it with a steely resolve, and fight.


The psychology of strategic decision-making: The decision-maker몭s 몬personal needs몭 are always in the background

These 몬needs몭 might be someone몭s personal ambitions, their financial interests or those of their company. They might be emotional 멪 some kind of unresolved complex or anxiety, or some sort of shadow cast by their psyche. These are all possibilities. To analyze a person몭s decision-making, it몭s important to consider one몭s own, personal viewpoint. When it몭s time for you to make decisions, you need to have awareness of 몬no self.몭 This means stripping away emotional and other personal factors from your decision-making. This is how you make the right choices.

몮There are roads which must not be followed.몯

Analysis:
There are some roads that, though possible to travel along, should not be taken. The opposite is also true: some roads are impossible to use, and yet there몭s a chance you might take them. This is where 몬variation몭 comes in to play.
Li Quan comments: 몮Some roads are narrow and dangerous, and may not be travelled lest one walk into an ambush.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮One should not follow roads which pass through dangerously narrow places; if there is no choice but to follow this road, then this is the result of variation.몯
We have already looked at the case study of Han Xin defeating the state of Zhao several times now. The story involves a road that should not have been used as a military route: Jingxing Pass. Han Xin only made the decision to pass through this place after he몭d received intelligence from his spies that the Zhao commander, Chen Yu, had opted not to use Li Zuoche몭s idea of sending part of the Zhao army to set an ambush at Jingxing Pass. If there had been an ambush, as Han Xin said to Li Zuoche after capturing him, 몮If Chen Yu had employed your stratagem, our respective situations would be reversed 멪 it is I who would be your prisoner.몯
몬The General who Calms the Waves,몭 Ma Yuan of the Han dynasty, lost the final battle in his campaign to put down a rebellion of five non-Chinese ethnic groups precisely because he took the wrong road.
When Ma Yuan and his vice general, Geng Shu, first mobilized their troops, they won some early victories that forced the barbarian armies to hide in the mountain forests. Ma Yuan was ready to close in on the enemies몭 base, but first he had to choose which of two roads to take. The route through Chong County had good roads, but was very long, while the route from Hutou was short, but also dangerous, because it would involve water travel.
Ma Yuan decided that it would waste too much grain to take the long, land route through Chong County, and that the better option was to take the water route. Anyway, he thought, if he could take the enemy base directly, Chong County would be his, too, and without any extra fighting.
However, Geng Shu strongly disagreed. He said that the land road might be long, but it was safer. Even if they were unable to break into the enemy Miao territory, they몭d have an easy route to retreat. He argued that the water route was too dangerous, unless they could somehow reach the enemy base undetected. Otherwise, the enemy could easily take up positions above them, on the high ground to either side of the water. Unless by some miracle they could grow wings, they몭d be stuck in deep water and wedged between high hills, doomed to a watery grave.
But Ma Yuan wouldn몭t change his mind. He argued that the land route wasn몭t so safe, anyway 멪 there could be an ambush anywhere. Neither man could convince the other, so they sent a message detailing their positions to the imperial court. In the end, Emperor Guangwu supported Ma Yuan몭s opinion. 
So, the Han army embarked on boats and travelled upriver into Hutou. It went exactly as Geng Shu predicted: the Miao fighters quickly found out what the Han army was up to, and took up a strong position on high ground above the narrow river. This was the Yuan River, whose  fast-flowing waters made it difficult for boats to move against the current, and their slow progress, combined with the sticky summer heat, caused sickness among the troops. Whole chunks of the army died, including Ma Yuan himself.
Why did Ma Yuan make this mistake?
First of all, the land route wasn몭t necessarily the right choice, either. We judge choices as being 몬right몭 or 몬wrong몭 in hindsight, by looking at the result. But, in reality, what we call 몬right몭 isn몭t necessarily right, and what we call 몬wrong몭 isn몭t necessarily wrong.
Having said that, there몭s no doubt that the water route was dangerous, and the more risky choice overall. By choosing it, Ma Yuan was gambling with his life. Why did he do that? If you look at Ma Yuan몭s psychology and his emotional landscape before the campaign, you can see that the writing was already on the wall.
When the campaign started, Ma Yuan was already sixty-two years old.
When the 몬barbarian몭 forces raided Jun County, Emperor Guangwu sent 몬the General of Martial Power,몭 Liu Shang, to deal with them. Liu was defeated and his army destroyed at a battle by the Yuan River. The next year, a respected senior general, Li Song, and Ma Cheng, governor of Zhongshan, were sent out into the field, but still the Han army couldn몭t make positive gains. Ma Yuan then asked for permission to lead an army out, but Emperor Guangwu refused, out of concern that Ma Yuan was too old. But Ma Yuan protested: 몮Your servant is still capable of donning armor and mounting a horse.몯 So, Emperor Guangwu ordered him to do a test ride on a horse. Ma Yuan jumped into the saddle, and turned to look at the Emperor, eager to show he still had what it takes. The Emperor laughed, and said: 몮I declare this fellow hearty and hale!몯 He ordered Ma Yuan to lead Geng Shu, Commander of the Palace Guard Ma Wu, Liu Kuang, Sun Yong and various other generals 멪 along with a force of over 40,000 soldiers 멪 to put down the barbarian rebellion.
As they set out, Ma Yuan bade a nighttime farewell to various people who had come to see him off on his expedition. To his friend Du Yin, he said: 몮I am an old man now. I have often worried that I would not have the opportunity to die for my country, but today, my wish has been granted. Now I can die at peace.몯
Ma Yuan was determined to be a martyr. In fact, he몭s the original source for a well-known idiom in Chinese that refers to dying on the battlefield: 몬corpse wrapped in horse hide.몭 He apparently said: 몮A man ought to die in the wilderness, his body wrapped in horse hide to be carried home for burial. How could I just lay in bed and let myself be possessed by evil spirits, in the hands of my children?몯 All he wanted was to die on the battlefield, and not at home in bed.
Ma Yuan was an old man when he set out to put down the Miao rebellion, and he no longer cared whether he died. For him, this was the last chance to win glory in service of his country. Of course he knew the dangers of the water route 멪 how could he not, after spending his whole life fighting? But this particular war against the Miao had already dragged on for two years, and three Han commanders-in-chief had already been recalled and replaced. The only thing to be said for the land road was that it made for an easy retreat. It was good for self-preservation, but not necessarily good for winning.
몮This will be my last war 멪 if I don몭t establish my legacy now, there will be no more chances.몯 Ma Yuan had decided to gamble with his life.
But why were the young people in his army willing to follow this old man and gamble on their own lives?
Stranded in a river valley, unable to move forward or backward, disease was spreading rampantly through the ranks of the Han army, and men were dying in droves every day. Geng Shu was beside himself with anxiety. But he was a young man, and a young man몭s words carry no weight. The Emperor would never listen to him, so there was nothing he could do. He wrote a letter to his elder brother, Geng Yan, telling of the situation and asking him to go and talk with the Emperor.
Geng Yan could tell the situation was serious, and he immediately requested an audience with the Emperor. His words carried more weight than his younger brother몭s, and the military situation really was dire, so Emperor Guangwu sent Liang Song to ask Ma Yuan some hard questions, and to supervise the army몭s operations. By the time Liang Song arrived at the army몭s locations, Ma Yuan was already dead.
In the end, the Han forces didn몭t win their war. Instead, they came up with a plan that resulted in the Miao forces murdering their leader and surrendering. The rebellion was over.
Ma Yuan gambled with his life, and in return his name became immortal thanks to the idiom 몬corpse wrapped in horse hide.몭 But he wasn몭t the only one. Because of him, many thousands of Han soldiers and officers also went home wrapped in horsehide.
It몭s possible that this psychological analysis of Ma Yuan몭s decision-making is just my own, subjective judgment. But멞
Whenever a strategic decision is being made, the decision-maker몭s 몬personal needs몭 are always lurking in the background.
몬No self몭 is an objective rock to stand on. Make a decision with 몬no self,몭 and it몭s guaranteed.


Not fighting: An important element of war

Extract from the original text:
몮There are armies which must not be attacked.몯

Analysis:
Sometimes, though it may be possible to attack the enemy army, you don몭t do it.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Though an army may be attacked, if the terrain be adverse and difficult to travel, then lingering there will cause you to lose formerly held advantages, and taking it will give you only a meager advantage. If the enemy army is small and beleaguered, it will certainly fight unto death.몯
If you find a small, down-on-its-luck enemy force holed up in the kind of terrain that can easily turn into a deathtrap, there몭s not much to gain by wiping them out. In fact, doing so would mean paying a big price, possibly even holding up your entire war plan. If that몭s the case, don몭t fight.
Du Mu, in his commentary, writes that this line refers back to earlier lines: 몮Do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen; do not interfere with an army that is returning home; do not press a desperate foe too hard; do not attack terrain where death abounds.몯 These all refer to armies that shouldn몭t be attacked. Du Mu also raises one other situation where an army shouldn몭t be attacked. Namely, if your army is stronger than the enemy몭s, and the enemy vanguard arrives before the rest of their forces, don몭t attack them straight away and cause them to run. Wait until the rest of the enemy troops show up, and then take down their whole army in one fell swoop. 
Jia Lin comments: 몮Causing your enemy to submit without fighting him is supreme excellence.몯 If you can cause your enemy to surrender, there is no need to attack. He also saw that if the enemy forces, though hard-pressed, are holding a position in dangerous terrain, such that attacking them will result in 몮a fight unto death,몯 don몭t attack. Wait patiently for the enemy몭s situation to change, and wait for them to become sloppy, and then take them.
Zhang Yu adds: 몮There is no harm in indulging the enemy, and nothing to gain by defeating them.몯 This is another kind of situation where you shouldn몭t attack.
Don몭t be greedy for small gains. When all that몭s on offer is a few tasteless scraps, you don몭t lose anything by not eating. On the contrary, if you see some small gain dangling in front of you, and immediately want to take it, you몭re delaying your real business and potentially sabotaging your grand plan.
We몭ve already talked about how marching is a part of war, one that might even be more important than actually fighting. We몭ve also talked about how camping is a part of war. Now, we몭re beginning to see that not fighting is also an element of war. This is about weighing pros and cons, and it몭s about being able to see the overall picture. If you weigh up the pros and cons, it몭s not worth killing 1,000 enemy troops if it means losing 800 of your own. In terms of the bigger picture, a low-level gain might end up having a negative effect on your overall position, perhaps because it delays the day of the battle that몭s going to win you the war.
It seems like quite a simple sentence 멪 몬There are armies which must not be attacked몭 멪 that you몭d think you could understand it the moment you hear it. Yet, we need to remember that when we read books and study, the aim is to bring what we learn into our own lives. If we apply this notion to our own lives, we find that there isn몭t a single day when we actually live up to these words. We몭re unable to actually not do certain things: not get sucked in to certain social engagements, or not drink alcohol in certain situations.
Don몭t let yourself think that you몭re a hardworking, honorable caricature of a person, or that you몭re some brave, mythical warrior. And don몭t let yourself feel guilty whenever you stop working for a moment to rest. If you keep yourself busy to the point of organ failure on a daily basis, if you몭re constantly grasping after every opportunity you get a sniff of, you몭ll end up losing what you already have because you몭re distracted by going after things you don몭t have. This mentality doesn몭t work; you몭ll never be able to really build anything.
It몭s better to just stop, do some proper planning, and work out what exactly it is that you want.


The art of war for rebels: The name of the game is speed

Extract from the original text:
몮There are towns which must not be besieged.몯

Analysis:
Some cities, though it may be possible to take them by force, should not be attacked.
Cao Cao comments: 몮If the city walls are small but solid, and if the grain supplies are ample, then one must not attack it. This is why I laid aside thoughts of capturing the cities of Hua and Fei, and instead plunged deep into Xu Province, by which action I gained territory of forty counties.몯
Du Mu, in his commentary, says that if your enemy is positioned at a strategic point, and has dug deep moats and stored up vast amounts of grain, their intention is to hole up and delay your forces. If you attack him and manage pull him out by the roots, there몭s not much benefit for you. Even worse is if you attack him but can몭t beat him 멪 that몭ll really scupper your war plans. In this situation, don몭t attack.
This line, 몬There are towns which must not be besieged,몭 is more important for rebels than for anyone else. This is 몬The Art of War for Rebels.몭 Or, at least, you could call it that.
If you몭re ever thinking of starting a rebellion, the best plan you could choose is to take the capital city as quickly as physically possible, and get rid of the Emperor. Then, you get to be Emperor. But if, for whatever reason, your progress gets held up, the whole country will mobilize to come to their Emperor몭s rescue, and before you know it you몭ll be faced with a massive army standing in your way. At that point, your rebellion몭s a lost cause.
We몭ve already looked at how the Ming dynasty statesman Wang Yangming defeated the Prince of Ning몭s rebellion. If the Prince of Ning had focused all his strength on taking the city of Anqing, the capital, Nanjing, would be within his grasp. Once he entered Nanjing, he몭d have the political capital to declare himself Emperor, and once he몭d done that, all the government officials and court politicians would be forced to choose a side. The Zhengde Emperor, who was in power at the time, was laughably unsuited to be the 몬Son of Heaven,몭 so the Prince of Ning wasn몭t lacking for opportunity.
Wang Yangming, taking advantage of the fact that the Prince of Ning몭s stronghold city, Nanchang, was undefended, marched in and took it, gambling that the Prince of Ning would withdraw his army and attempt to take back Nanchang. The Prince몭s advisors tried to reason with him until they were red in the face: 몮There are towns which must not be besieged! We don몭t need Nanchang! Once we have Nanjing, the whole world will be ours 멪 including Nanchang! If we get bogged down in Nanchang, we몭ll lose our chance. We몭ll be finished!몮
But the Prince of Ning couldn몭t stand the thought of his home city being captured, so he abandoned his siege of Anqing, which had been about to fall, and pulled his armies back toward Nanchang. He never made it there 멪 he was captured by Wang Yangming when he was only half-way back, at Poyang Lake.
The Prince of Ning was inspired to launch his rebellion partly by the earlier success of Zhu Kang, who became Emperor Chengzu of the Ming dynasty. But Zhu Kang몭s strategy was precisely that 몬there are towns which must not be besieged.몭 At the start of Zhu Kang몭s uprising, he spent a lot of time stuck in stalemate. He was mostly fighting in Hebei and Shandong Provinces, and although his army (the Yan army) won slightly more than they lost, he suffered heavy casualties, while the imperial army had a massive pool of manpower to call upon. If the imperial commanders could drag the conflict out, Zhu Kang would be unable to get the better of them.
Later in the war, Zhu Kang got word from an imperial court eunuch in his service that Nanjing was poorly defended. So, he changed his whole strategy, drew up a large army, and personally led it directly to Nanjing. He fought his way to Yangzhou, at which point an imperial naval commander named Chen Xuan surrendered to Zhu Kang, handing him a fleet. He crossed the Yangzi River, made his way down to Zhenjiang, and then straight to Nanjing, where Zhu Hui, Prince of Gu, and Li Jinglong opened the Jinchuan gate and surrendered. Zhu Kang몭s rebellion had succeeded.
During the reign of Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang dynasty (665-690 CE), Xu Jingye attempted a rebellion. His advisors urged him to move directly on the city of Luoyang, which Empress Wu had turned into the new capital city. If he did that, they몭d suggested, he몭d be cutting straight to the heart of the Empress몭 power, and he could neutralize the fact that she had far more followers than him. It might also bring more people to his cause, which was the only hope for his rebellion bid to succeed. But Xu Jingye chose not to move north toward Luoyang, and instead marched south with ambitions to capture the cities of Changzhou, Zhenjiang and the old imperial capital Nanjing, where he planned to finally achieve his dream of becoming an Emperor. But, this move sent a clear message to everyone: his ambition only went as far as separatism. He was just interested in carving out a kingdom independent from the Tang dynasty, without actually replacing it. So, nobody followed him.
Du Mu also wrote about another rebellion, that of a man named Shen Youzhi, who held de facto control of Jing Province. He몭d attempted a rebellion against Emperor Shun (477-479 CE) of the Liu Song dynasty. He was well funded: according to historical documents, he몭d built up a force of 100,000 men and 2,000 armored horses, and had significant stockpiles of grain. When he made his move, the first target for his rebel army was the city of Ying. A minister named Cang Yin of the Bureau of Merit once said that it is easy for shifts to occur in the balance of energy between attackers and defenders. In the case of the city of Ying, it was easy to defend and difficult to attack. It certainly couldn몭t be taken unless you committed 10-15 days to besieging it. And, if you weren몭t able to capture it smoothly, your aura of strength would dissipate, along with the initial sharpness of your energy. The soldiers in rebel armies never have much say; they become rebels whether they like it or not. So, at the first inkling that things aren몭t going well, the rebel army몭s entire mentality changes. What Shen Youzhi should have done was steer clear of Ying and instead move down the river and take the city of Jiankang (an older name for Nanjing). If he몭d done that, he could have torn the Liu Song dynasty up by the roots, and Ying would have fallen into his hands by Shen Youzhi몭s imperial decree.
Shen Youzhi didn몭t listen to his advisors, and even though he committed all of his best troops to attacking the city of Ying, he was denied victory by the Commandery Governor, Liu Shilong. The soldiers who had followed Shen could now see that even this, the very first battle, was far from an easy task. They saw that their rebellion몭s chances of success were extremely slim, and so, unwilling to be convicted for a crime that would see them and their entire families executed, they deserted. Shen몭s rebel army fell apart. He realized that he몭d lost control of the situation, and walked alone into a forest and hanged himself. And that was the end of his life몭s work, his rebellion. It had been pure foolishness.
In another, later era, military strategists in a certain western country developed a strategy that has been summarized as 몬deep battle몭 or 몬strategic paralysis.몭 It몭s about driving deep into the enemy country몭s heart and paralyzing their central nervous system. When you do this, the whole country surrenders. Don몭t fuss around with setting up new camps and new defensive lines with every forward step you take; in fact, don몭t even wait for your supply line to catch up with you. The key is to be quick. This is none other than Hitler몭s and Guderian몭s blitzkrieg (몬flash war몭) method of warfare.


There몭s a price to pay for everything

In Chinese society, we have a culture of 몬talking big.몭 For example, people love to talk about doing things 몬no matter what the cost.몭 In reality, there몭s nothing in this world that is beyond calculations of 몬cost.몭 There몭s a price to pay for everything.

Extract from the original text:
몮There are positions which must not be contested.몯

Analysis:
There are some places that, although it might be possible to take them by force, you shouldn몭t fight over.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Positions which can bring only small benefit are liable to cause loss as soon as they have been won; therefore, do not contest them.몯 
Du Mu comments: 몮It is said that there is no harm in losing a position which, once gained, is difficult to defend. Wu Zixu once advised Fuchai thus: 몬If today we attack Qi and take their land, that land will be alike to a field full of stones; it would be better to make haste and take action in Yue.몭몯
Wu Zixu wanted Fuchai, King of Wu, to try to seize the land of the state of Yue, and not of the state of Qi. His reasoning was this: both Wu and Yue were southerly kingdoms, so the land of Yue would be easy both to defend and to farm for the people of Wu. But, the state of Qi was in the north, and its land wouldn몭t be much use to the Wu invaders; it would also be difficult to defend against invaders.
However, Fuchai was already very happy with life at that time. He was enjoying the pampering being showered on him by the King of Yue, Goujian. He spent his days in the arms of the renowned beauty, Xi Shi, who had been gifted to him by Goujian. He fundamentally didn몭t believe there was any need to wipe out the state of Yue. Instead, his interests were much more focused on the Central Plain region to the north. He wanted to fight with the states of Qi and Jin in a bid to establish himself as undisputed ruler of the known world. 
So, Fuchai fell into Goujian몭s trap 멪 the stratagem of sowing discord 멪 and ordered Wu Zixu to be killed. Then, just as Fuchai had moved north at the head of an army, Goujian seized his chance. While the lands of Wu were unguarded, he launched a sudden attack, during which he killed the crown prince. Several years later, the state of Wu was obliterated by Yue, and Fuchai killed himself.
As students of history, it몭s hard not to give a wistful sigh every now and then. Wu Zixu did such good work for his country, and he was so important to Wu 멪 how could Fuchai kill him? How could he be so self-destructive? The reason we might think this way is because of our position. We몭re observers. From Fuchai몭s point of view, the power and success of Wu was his own work, and he certainly would never give the credit to Wu Zixu.
Du Mu also writes about another historical example. It몭s the story of a general named Tao Kan. 
During the Eastern Jin dynasty (317-420 CE), Tao Kan was stationed in the Wuchang garrison. Across the Yangzi River, on the north bank, there was a city called Zhucheng. The officers around Tao Kan were all trying to talk him into sending an army to take Zhucheng, but Tao Kan ignored them. The officers kept pushing the idea, so Tao Kan took them across the river on a hunting trip.
During the trip, he went near Zhucheng, and told them: 몮The reason why I foresee danger here and opt for a defensive posture is because of the danger presented by the Yangzi River. Zhucheng is on the north bank; it has no hinterland upon which to rely, and it is menaced by barbarians from outside. Lusting after the profit to be gained from Zhucheng will not only lead us into a place that is impossible to defend, but it will also incite barbarians to come. So, gaining Zhucheng will bring no benefit to our lands south of the river; on the contrary, it would invite disaster.몯
Years later, the Jin general Yu Liang attempted to hold Zhucheng, and sure enough, he suffered a crushing defeat.
To gain territory, the highest price must be paid, and the people must suffer the greatest misery. The so-called 몬Emperor Wu the Great몭 of the Han dynasty once said: 몮Any who dare use force against Han will surely be brought to the executioner, no matter how far away they may be.몯 Because of these words, many people today think of Emperor Wu as a great hero, and he몭s hailed in history books as a great ruler and military leader. And yet, if you actually lived during the time of his reign, your fate would have been one of misery, and no escape. You could go to the front lines and lose your life on a blood-soaked battlefield, or you could stay at home and suffer all kinds of hardships, because Emperor Wu bankrupted the entire country.
In his later years, as the country tottered on the brink of collapse, and under enormous political pressure, he published his famous self-criticism, in which he called himself 몮arrogant and unreasonable.몯 On that count, he was right.
Some 800 years later, the Tang dynasty poet Du Fu left behind one of the most famous Chinese poems of all, A Song of War Chariots, which speaks of the time when Emperor Wu was fighting his wars of expansion:
몮Frontiers on which enough blood has flowed to make a sea,
Yet our Emperor still would expand his authority!
Have you not heard how east of Huashan two hundred counties are nothing but weed-choked villages, desolate with thorns?
Strong women till the fields, yet crops come not as well as before; 
Lads from around here are well known for their bravery, but hate to be driven like dogs or chickens;
Only because you kindly ask me do I dare give vent to grievances;
Now the year is ending, yet the men from the western frontier still have not returned; the government demands immediate payment of taxes, but how can we pay when so little has been produced? 
Now, we peasants have learnt one thing: To have a son is not so good as having a daughter
A daughter can marry a neighbor and still be near us, while a son will be taken away to die in the grass in some wild place몯


The words 몬Sometimes, the lord몭s orders may not be received몭 are meant for the ears of kings and lords, not for battle commanders

If a commander on the front lines wants to be able to 몬not receive몭 his lord몭s commands, first he must be committed to sacrificing himself.

Extract from the original text:
몮There are commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.몯

Analysis:
Sometimes, orders from the leader of the country should not be obeyed. For example, if a command doesn몭t take into account the actual situation on the front line, it should be rejected.
This line 멪 몮There are commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed몯 멪 is one of the most famous passages in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War. Cao Cao comments: 몮Providing that it be expedient to handling affairs, one should not be constrained by the sovereign몭s commands.몯 If it몭s good for your battle position, there몭s no need to stick to the letter of the sovereign몭s orders.
There몭s a passage in the Wei Liaozi that reads: 몮War is a matter of deadly weapons; to fight in a war is to defy morality, and to be a general is to be a dead man. For him, there is no heaven above, no earth below, no enemy in front, and no lord behind.몯
This passage means that battle commanders work in the space between life and death, and nothing is off the table for them if it means surviving 멪 there are no moral standards, no law and no heaven above. The 몬king몭 ceases to exist.
But is that really true?
If it were true, it would be impossible to command an army.
Because generals sometimes don몭t obey commands from their rulers, so too there are junior officers who sometimes don몭t obey commands from the general. If everyone몭s making their own judgment calls, and ignoring the judgment of their senior commanders, how are you supposed to control an army?
This brings us to two concepts that are crucial to understanding this passage.
First, this line is mainly intended to be read by kings and lords. Its message to them is that they should let the people who are actually within earshot of the cannons to do the decision-making, and rein in, as much as they can, their impulse to 몬remote control몭 the army.
Secondly, this is about one of the 몬nine variations몭 멪 it몭s about staying open to change. What this means is that this isn몭t a normal situation; this is for special circumstances. This line is saying that, although it몭s a crime to disobey the sovereign몭s commands, a crime that carries the death penalty, if you find yourself in exceptional circumstances, in which obeying orders would mean certain death, while disobeying them would be good for the country, you can 몬adapt몭 and disobey. 
But, if you몭re a general, you absolutely shouldn몭t take the concept of 몬There are commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed몭 at face value. When this line was first written, the man who held the pen was a battle commander, and he was writing specifically for the eyes of kings and Emperors. His idea in writing this line was definitely not that it would be taken seriously only by generals and not by their kings. He wasn몭t trying to give generals the idea that nobody was above them on the decision-making ladder, and that they had the unique right to call the shots.
Let몭s take a look at the historical record, shall we? Was it actually true that sometimes the sovereign몭s orders could be ignored? The answer to that would be멞 no.
During the chaos of the Tang dynasty몭s An Lushan Rebellion, Imperial Commander Geshu Han was committed to holding a defensive position at his fortress in Tongguan Pass, and to keeping his army safe behind its thick walls. However, Emperor Xuanzong was piling pressure on him to come out and engage the enemy in the open. Geshu Han knew that fighting in the open would mean certain defeat. So, did the thought occur to him that 몬There are commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed?몭 Yes, it did. But there were consequences for those who disobeyed the sovereign몭s orders 멪  most notably, the death sentence. Geshu Han had already seen two prominent imperial generals meet this very fate at the hands of Emperor Xuanzong: Gao Xianzhi and Feng Changqing, both staunch pillars of the state. And so, Geshu Han came shaking and sobbing out of his fortress, leading the Tang army into battle. He lost, badly. Tongguan Pass fell to the enemy, Geshu Han was captured, and Emperor Xuanzong abandoned the capital city of Chang몭an and fled toward Sichuan.
Then there몭s the case of another toweringly famous Chinese general, Yue Fei. He nearly pulled off a stunning success during his northern expedition, but fell at the final hurdle. As he mulled his defeat, he received a summons from Emperor Gaozong, calling him back from the front line. Was it an option for him to disobey the Emperor몭s orders? If he몭d chosen that path, he몭d be dead 멪 the Emperor would send a Military Supervisor armed with an Imperial edict, and he몭d be executed it in his own camp. 
We can take another look here at a historical example from earlier on, to answer the question of whether or not a lower-ranking officer can disobey his general몭s orders.  It was covered in detail in an earlier chapter, but bears repeating.
There was an episode during the war between the states of Qin and Zhao in which a massive Qin army surrounded the city of Yuyu. The Zhao commander, Zhao She, marched his army to the city in a bid to break the Qin encirclement. But, he halted his army with thirty li of road left before reaching the city of Handan, set up camp and fortified his position. Pretending he had no intention of moving any closer to the enemy, he circulated an order through his army: 몮Any man who offers unsolicited suggestions regarding military matters shall be executed!몯
Meanwhile, as the Qin army carried on its siege of Yuyu, a secondary force was formed to hold off the Zhao army and prevent it from reaching the city. This secondary force moved directly to Wu몭an, splitting the Qin forces into two parts and positioning them in a pincer shape. In the Zhao camp, a junior officer, distraught with worry, went to Zhao She with urgent counsel. The gist of the officer몭s advice was that the army should hurry over to Wu몭an, otherwise this would happen and that would happen. As promised, Zhao She executed him on the spot.
Zhao She waited just long enough for the Qin forces to let down their guard and start believing he몭d only come to make it look like he was doing something to 몬relieve the besieged city,몭 but didn몭t actually want to fight. Then, all of a sudden, Zhao She made his move. With a light force, he marched non-stop, day and night, straight towards Yuyu. When he몭d reached within fifty li몭s distance of the city walls, he halted and set up camp. One of his soldiers, a man named Xu Li, looked at the terrain around the camp and came to Zhao She with a suggestion: 몮Victory will belong to whomever holds the mountain to the north. My lord, I hereby request that we set our camp atop the northern mountain, and that we draw defensive lines there.몯 Zhao She agreed with the idea. Then, Xu Li said: 몮I have said what I came to say. My lord, please execute me now in accordance with your decree!몯 Zhao She only said: 몮We will delay this matter until our return home.몯
Later, when the battle had been won and the Zhao army had returned home, Xu Li was promoted to the office of Defender in Chief.
What can we see from this case study? The first man, the one who was executed, could see part of what was going on, but not the full picture; he could see the outermost layer, but not the essence. So, his judgment fell short of his commanding officer몭s, yet he still tried to disobey his commander몭s orders, which led him straight to the executioner. His head was separated from his shoulders, and became a component in Zhao She몭s strategy.
The second man who disobeyed his commander몭s orders, Xu Li, had the sense that he was walking into certain death. According to his logic, his life belonged to the country, so if his words might be of use to the country, he would speak them and die with no regrets.
The lesson is that if you want to actually disobey certain orders from your superiors, you need to be committed to sacrificing yourself.

몮The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the 몬Five Advantages,몭 will fail to make the best use of his men.몯
 

This passage is a summary of the first part of this chapter of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War. If a general has complete understanding of how to vary his tactics to adapt to the changes mentioned above, he understands how to use military force. If he doesn몭t, even if he understands the terrain he몭s situated in, he won몭t be able to gain any advantage from it. If you try to command an army without understanding how to adapt your tactics, then even if you know about the 몬Five Advantages,몭 you still won몭t be able to unleash the full potential of your army몭s battle capability.
There몭s a concept that pops up here 멪 몬The Five Advantages몭 멪 which actually means the same thing as 몬The Nine Variations.몭 It refers to five different kinds of situations within the framework of the nine variations. What are they?
According to one interpretation, they are: 몬There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.몭  According to a different interpretation: 몬When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In a desperate position, you must fight.몭
To conclude, all it means is that you need to understand how to adapt to change.


The philosophy of risk and gain: You need to see risks within gains, and gains within risks

As you rush to make gains, don몭t forget to dodge risks. Human psychology is wired for wishful thinking and trusting in luck. Even when people see a risk hiding inside a potential gain, they believe that there몭s only a low chance of the risk actually happening. So, no need to worry! As for seeing gains within risks, people can see potential gains even when they몭re not really there, and they firmly believe that such gains will definitely pan out.

Extract from the original text:
몮Hence in the wise leader몭s plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may have confidence in accomplishing our tasks. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.몯

Analysis:
몮Hence in the wise leader몭s plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.몯
A wise leader has the ability to take into account gains and risks at the same time, and also has the ability to see when conditions are favourable, and when they몭re not.
There is some similarity here to the modern SWOT analytical framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats). 몬Gains몭 are the same as 몬opportunities,몭 and 몬risks몭 are the same as 몬threats.몭 It몭s essential that you pay attention to both sides, and not focus entirely on either one of them.
Cao Cao comments: 몮When amidst advantage, consider the risks; when amidst risk, consider the advantages; when encountering difficulties, exercise authority.몯
When you see a potential gain, pause to think a moment longer about what hidden risks and dangers might be lurking under the surface. When you see a potential risk, think for a moment about whether there몭s a positive side to it, and whether or not it can be turned into a gain. When you find yourself in a difficult or unexpected situation, it몭s important to understand how to adapt.
This comment by Cao Cao is a deep one. What about ourselves? It몭s easy to think about what gains might be hidden inside a risk, but difficult to think about what risks might be hidden inside a potential gain.
As we몭ve said, this is because human psychology is wired for wishful thinking. People are always greedy for gains and reluctant to get close to risks, and we몭re prone to trust in our own luck.
When we몭re greedy for gains, that몭s real greed. When we try to stay away from risks, it몭s more of a psychological response, recoiling from the idea of risk. Instead of actually trying to avoid risk, we trust luck and don몭t bother taking actual steps to prevent risk. When we see a potential gain, we know in our hearts that it involves some risk, but we believe that the danger won몭t actually happen. When we see a potential risk, we firmly believe there몭s something good hiding in the background, and we also believe that this good thing is definitely going to happen!
We can see this from the way that people explain and deconstruct the Chinese word for 몬crisis몭 멪 weiji. Wei means 몬danger,몭 and ji can mean 몬opportunity.몭 So: crisis = danger + opportunity. Therefore, the thinking goes, when there몭s a crisis, we need to turn danger into opportunity.
But this is incorrect. The ji in the Chinese word for 몬crisis몭 actually has a different root meaning 멪 몬trigger.몭 Don몭t pull the trigger. When your bills are due, pay them, and don몭t make a fuss about it.  Just accept that you몭re going to lose some money. This is the most positive way of dealing with the situation. Is there anyone alive who doesn몭t run up against at least some bad things in life? Don몭t always think about how to turn bad things into good things, and don몭t always look for a way to profit from them.
You can only win if you몭re also able to admit defeat. If you refuse to admit defeat 멪 to pay your dues 멪 and just keep plowing onward, not only will the dangers not turn into gains, they몭ll just keeping growing bigger. This is not the message that Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War is trying to teach us. 
Jia Lin comments: 몮Dangers and benefits are mixed together; the wise leader is about to ponder both and deal cautiously with both, and thus derive the benefit.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮The wise leader몭s way of contemplating things is thus: though he be situated in a favourable position, he absolutely considers the risks inherent in this position. Likewise, though he be situated in a dangerous position, he absolutely considers the benefits inherent in this position. This too is what we call 몬adapting to change.몭몯

몮If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may have confidence in accomplishing our tasks.몯

The words 몬tempered in this way몭 mean that the advantages are considered along with the risks intertwined within. The non-beneficial side of the situation, as well as the potential for danger, are both part of the leader몭s calculations. If you can address both sides of the situation, then we can have confidence in what we need to do, and we can make them into a reality.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Having calculated that the enemy is unable to harm me, and indeed lacks the position to do, I may have confidence in my tasks.몯
If you몭ve taken into account all the areas where the enemy might be able to hurt you, and if you몭ve found that, no matter how you add up the numbers, there몭s no way he can actually hurt you, your plan is workable.
Du Mu comments: 몮몬Confidence몭 refers to 몬reaching forth.몭 Sun Tzu몭s meaning is that if one desires to extract advantage from one몭s foe, it is not sufficient merely to perceive the advantage to be gained from the enemy; one must first add to one몭s calculations the ways in which the enemy may inflict harm. This being done, one can reach forth and execute one몭s tasks.몯
If you want to gain an advantage from someone, you can몭t only have eyes for the advantages. You need to take into consideration the ways in which the enemy might be able to hurt you. This is a step you must take for the things you want to accomplish to actually succeed.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Add that which presents danger to that which presents advantages. By doing this, one may reach forth and achieve one몭s objectives.몯
Zhang Yu also provides a case study. The ancient state of Zheng sent an army to attack the state of Cai. The Zheng army was victorious, and all the people of Zheng were happy, except for Zi Chan, who was deeply worried. 몮There is no greater catastrophe than a small country which is bereft of moral civilization, and yet experiences military triumph,몯 Zi Chan declared. He was proved right: not longer afterward, the state of Chu raised an army and moved to attack Zheng. Chu had always seen the state of Cai as part of its sphere of influence, and so, for Chu, it was a case of: 몬If you pick on my little brother, I몭m going to beat you up!몭

몮If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮If I wish to extricate myself from misfortunes caused by my foe, I must not only see the things that my enemy can do to harm me, I must also include in my calculations the advantages that I can extract from him. Having done this, I can then successfully extricate myself from misfortune. For instance, supposing I have been surrounded by enemy forces: If I know only to attempt to break through the encirclement, my men몭s force of will is sure to be feeble, and we shall surely be harried and struck down. But if I rouse the soldiers몭 spirits and vigorously carry the fight to the enemy, then the prospect of victory and the advantages it brings shall enable us to break the encirclement.몯
Jia Lin comments: 몮When in a position of danger, turn your mind to the advantages, and thereby you shall evade the danger. Thus, being confronted with death, one survives, and facing ruin, one persists. This is what is meant by 몬extricating ourselves from misfortune.몭몯
Zhang Yu gives another case study for this line of thinking: The Rebellion of the Eight Princes during the time of the Western Jin dynasty (266-317 CE). There was a general named Zhang Fang who, after taking the capital city, Luoyang, suffered a string of defeats. He was advised by some to flee, but he said: 몮It is entirely normal in armies for shifts to occur between potency and dullness, and the most precious victory comes from defeat.몯 That night, his army sneaked right up under the enemy몭s noses and defeated them in combat.
The second part of what Zhang Fang said gives readers much to chew on: that the most valuable victory comes straight out of failure. In other words, you can fail over and over again, and still end up achieving your goal. This is exactly how it works with scientific inventions and experiments, and with entrepreneurs building new businesses. In the final analysis, all success is a result of failure. If you keep moving with the flow, even as you rack up one failure after another, as long as you constantly review those failures, learn from them and apply what you몭ve learned, you will ultimately succeed.


몬The art of harm몭 teaches us not to let people harm us

This part of The Art of War teaches us how to hurt people. Take a quick look at this passage 멪 that몭s all that몭s necessary. The message is simple enough: Don몭t let anyone hurt you, and even more importantly, don몭t hurt other people.

Extract from the original text:
몮Subdue hostile barons by inflicting damage on them; encumber them with constant engagements; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.몯

Analysis:
몮Subdue hostile barons by inflicting damage on them.몯
Come up with a way of making them do things that aren몭t in their own interests, so that they몭re unable to unfurl their strength to its full extent.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Damage him in ways that he would consider pernicious.몯 
Li Quan comments: 몮Damage him politically.몯
Jia Lin comments: 몮Use harmful strategems 멪 each one is different: perhaps one may entice the wise men and ministers in his court, so that he is deprived of advisors; or avail yourself of underhanded men, and through them sabotage his decrees and commands; or employ underhanded tricks to sow discord between the king and his advisors; or send ingenious craftsmen to him, and thus exhaust his people and empty his coffers; or use gifts of debauchery and pleasure to corrupt the social currents of his realm; or give him beautiful women to ensnare his mind. Each of these stratagems, if conducted in total secrecy, is capable of harming people and causing them to submit.몯
All of this is about how to hurt people. As I몭ve said, for us it몭s enough just to take a look and move on.
몮Entice the wise men and ministers in his court, so that he is deprived of advisors.몯 If you can draw capable people away from your enemy, he won몭t have anyone he can depend on. Lift up the unscrupulous men in his court, and his administration will rot from the inside; use trickery to create divisions between the enemy and his advisors.
There are many historical examples of this, including ones we몭ve already examined in previous chapters. In the Battle of Changping, between the states of Qin and Zhao, Qin sent a spy to the Zhao city of Handan to spread rumors that the Zhao commander-in-chief, Lian Po, wasn몭t going to fight, and that he actually was planning to surrender to Qin. There was also another rumor 멪 that the Qin generals weren몭t worried about the idea of facing Lian Po, but were scared stiff of a different Zhao general, Zhao Kuo. The goal of these rumors was to make the Zhao authorities call Lian Po back from the front lines and send out Zhao Kuo instead. Zhao Kuo would march to his death.
몮Send ingenious craftsmen to him, and thus exhaust his people and empty his coffers.몯 The idea here is to make the enemy spend money on big projects, such as building grand summer palaces. Then, he won몭t have any money left to spend on his army.
During Japan몭s Warring States period, after the death of Tiyetomi Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu[bd28] used precisely this trick to destroy the rest of the Tiyetomi family. He contrived to cause Hideyoshi몭s wife, Yodo Dono, and his son, Hideyori, to launch a huge project building Buddhist temples, with the aim of making them use up all of their gold and leaving them unable to recruit new soldiers.

몮Encumber them with constant engagements.몯

This is about finding things that will cause the enemy headaches, keep him busy and wear him out.
Cao Cao comments: 몮몬Engagements몭 refers to 몬problems.몭 Cause him to become weary and irritated. When he advances, I retreat; when he retreats, I advance. That is what this is about.몯
Cause headaches for your enemy. For example, if he turns back, you should move out into the field. If he moves out, you should retreat. We have a good historical example of this from earlier in the book: the Spring and Autumn period state of Wu몭s campaign of harassment against the state of Chu. Recall that Wu Zixu split the Wu army into three forces, and then made as if to attack, taking only one of the three forces. The state of Chu mobilized its full army in response, only for the Wu force to suddenly head back home. Once the Chu army had disbanded, the second Wu force would suddenly show up in Chu and start causing problems, causing the Chu authorities to once again mobilize their entire army. And, once again, the Wu army promptly turned around and went home. Then, the third Wu force did the same thing. After several rounds of this, the state of Chu was exhausted and on the brink of a nervous breakdown. It was at this moment that Wu mobilized all three of its armies at once, captured the Chu capital, the city of Ying, and became the first Spring and Autumn period state to capture another state몭s capital city.
During the Warring States period, the state of Han had a plan to exhaust its rival, the state of Qin. It successfully enticed the Qin leaders into spending vast human and material resources on a huge irrigation project. They initiated this by sending a hydro engineer named Zheng Guo to the Qin court, where he pushed the massive, resource-intensive project forward.  This left Qin without the energy to carry on its invasions against other states to the east. Zheng Guo designed a huge irrigation project for Qin, which would divert the Jing River a distance of over 300 li and into the city of Luoyang. But while the project was under construction, the Han king몭s plot was exposed. The Qin king wanted to kill Zheng Guo, but the engineer protested: 몮It몭s true that, at first, the Han King wanted me to work as his agent, but this irrigation project won몭t do anything for Han apart from giving it a few years of grace. Meanwhile, this project is a great achievement of the state of Qin, one that will endure for generations.몯 The Qin king몭s officials could see the sense in Zheng Guo몭s words, so he was allowed to continue overseeing the irrigation project.
Once Zheng Guo몭s irrigation project was completed, it radically changed the agricultural productivity of the entire Guanzhong region. Guanzhong had very little rainfall and poor soil quality, and yet it became one of the richest farming regions in all of China. So, the Han plan to 몬encumber몭 and exhaust the state of Qin actually had the opposite effect: it helped Qin to accomplish an era-defining achievement.

몮Hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.몯

Use the power of temptation to make the enemy go exactly where you want them.
Cao Cao comments: 몮This is about making him come of his own accord.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Use the prospect of some small advantage to move him; make it inevitable that he will rush where you want him.몯
This part of The Art of War teaches us how to hurt people. As I몭ve suggested, take a quick look 멪  that몭s all that몭s necessary. Don몭t let anyone hurt you, and even more importantly, don몭t hurt other people.

Stay safe but always be mindful of danger; Practice good governance but be mindful of potential chaos; This is the way to keep danger and chaos from becoming reality. Solve problems every day, and be ready for things to go wrong at any moment, because things inevitably do go wrong. It would be impossible for nothing to ever go wrong. This is exactly what being a leader is about: solving problems and smoothing things out.

Extract from the original text:
몮The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy몭s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.몯

Analysis:
Military principles tell us not to pin our hopes on the possibility that the enemy just won몭t turn up. Rather, we몭re supposed to depend on having made ample preparations and being ready to deal with them when they come. Don몭t hold false hope that your enemy won몭t attack you; make sure you have the strength and the solutions that will stop the enemy from defeating you when they do attack.
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Never be idle; let this be what you rely upon.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮When safe, do not forget danger. This is about constantly making preparations.몯 Always be on your guard.
In the ancient strategist Wu Qi몭s writings about the art of being a general, he says: 몮Whenever you go out of your house, act as though you had just seen your enemy before you.몯 In other words, keep yourself in a state of heightened alertness.
Then there몭s this line, from the ancient historical text, The Zuo Commentary: 몮He who does not prepare or make predictions is not fit to serve as a general.몯
Wang Xi comments: 몮In general, that which leads to victory in war can be called 몬striking where the enemy is weak and attacking where they are sluggish.몭 The moment you show weakness or a lack of energy, you are immediately placing yourself in grave danger, because this is precisely what your enemy, lined up in neat battle formation, is waiting for. So, if you can consistently keep your battle lines in good order, the enemy will never come.몯
People often say that there몭s no point to making preparations if the enemy doesn몭t come; that it몭s a waste of time. But, in reality, the enemy didn몭t come precisely because you made those preparations. If you hadn몭t done so, the enemy would be breathing down your neck in an instant.
So, when something happens, you need to solve the problem. If nothing몭s happened yet, you need to be prepared for something to happen at any moment. An anxiety-free life is just not possible for leaders 멪 for them, each and every day is a journey through anxiety and highly-strung nerves.
Wang Xi gives us several examples to think about:
몮In ancient days, the people of Jin dug deep moats and erected high walls to defend against the military threat posed by Qin. The people of Jin waited for the Qin armies to come, and the Qin commanders could not remain long in the lands of Jin. The Chu armies lined up in battle formations, so that when the Wu forces arrived to fight, they retreated upon seeing that their foe was well prepared. Cheng Bushi was inflexible and rigid as a general. He instilled exacting order upon the ranks of his army, and he also instilled order while marching and setting camps; his men used their mess bowls as drums; he kept military documents in tight order; and no man violated his rules. When Zhu Ran became a general, he ordered his troops to beat the drums every day at dawn and dusk, even when all seemed at peace in the world. When in camp, everybody stayed equipped and ready to march in formation at all times, which rendered enemies unable to calculate how to prepare. Thus, whenever he moved, he recorded new successes.몯
The parts about the conflicts between Jin and Qin, and Wu and Chu are self-explanatory. The next part, about Cheng Bushi, is especially interesting. Cheng Bushi was a renowned general of the Han dynasty, and a contemporary of another famous general, Li Guang. These two men were both extreme in their own ways, and since they represent opposite ends of the spectrum, they몭re often compared against each other.
But today, while stories of 몬the flying general,몭 Li Guang, are family favorites across China, few know about Cheng Bushi. This is because of the sheer number of stories about Li Guang, and the total lack of stories about Cheng Bushi; it몭s possible that Cheng barely fought any battles at all. But, why is that? It몭s because his enemies were too scared to attack him. He might not be able to score a victory against you, but one thing몭s for certain: he would never be defeated.
Why is it that Cheng Bushi couldn몭t be beaten? It was all down to his extreme strictness and caution. First, 몮He instilled exacting order upon the ranks of his army,몯 meaning that his chain of command was enforced with extremely tight discipline at every level. Next, 몮He instilled order while marching and setting camps.몯 He constructed his camps methodically and with a high level of detail, and when it was time for his army to move, it moved as a single unit. Whenever he몭d made camp, his enemies would never be able to dislodge him, no matter how hard they charged his lines. As for the mess bowls, these were the copper vessels used by soldiers at meal times, and they were also used as drums by sentries during their patrol rounds. There are some lines relating to this from a poem by the Tang poet Du Fu: 몮Thoughts turning to men shouldering spears, who pass years guarding borders; Suddenly, at dusk someone beats their copper bowl, its noise jarring in all directions.몯
When Cheng Bushi was on the march, he sent scouts ahead of the main force, and a rear guard behind, and he stayed so alert that his camps were practically airtight. He was supremely well prepared, never leaving a base uncovered.
몮He kept military documents in tight order.몯 He did paperwork every evening, which kept him busy all through the night, until dawn the next day. This is how he never let the Xiongnu get the better of him. Yet, he never won any impressive victories, and the soldiers who served under him never had a moment몭s rest. Life in his army was extremely tense, and extremely hard work.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have General Li Guang. He never had anything even slightly resembling a well-ordered chain of command. Instead, he formed close personal bonds with his junior officers; his army was a band of brothers. He didn몭t keep any particular order or structure when marching, and he was quite happy to set up camp any old place, as long as there was a water source. Troops were allowed to make their own arrangements, and generally do things in whatever way suited them, and Li Guang never used the mess-bowl sentry drum system. So, soldiers loved serving under Li Guang, and dreaded having to go with Cheng Bushi. The Xiongnu felt the same way about the two Chinese generals 멪 they loved fighting against Li Guang, and they knew that picking a fight with Cheng Bushi would only bring them bad luck. That몭s why Cheng Bushi was never defeated. He was so well prepared that even his enemies didn몭t want anything to do with him; the mere thought of him was depressing to them.
With Li Guang, it was always either a massive victory or a massive defeat. He was once taken captive by his enemies, only to pull off a brilliant escape plan involving a fake illness and stealing horses. He was later sentenced to death, bought a pardon and was reduced to the status of a commoner, but was eventually reinstated to the rank of general. In the end, after losing his way on the battlefield and finding himself powerless to achieve his objective, the shame was too much for him to bear, and he killed himself.
The way Li Guang did things was not how armies are supposed to be run. In fact, he didn몭t even manage his forces in any formal sense. This made him incapable of leading large armies, although he had the ability to lead a small band of brothers-at-arms. This is why the Emperor never trusted him with command of the main Imperial army, and instead tasked him with assistant roles, such as small-scale flanking strikes. He won glory on the battlefield with great consistency, and became extremely famous, and yet he was never rewarded with any noble title. This even became a joke, immortalized in the lines of a Tang poem: 몮How easy it is for Feng Lao to grow old, and how hard for Li Guang to win a noble title.몯
So, who should be our role model: Li Guang or Cheng Bushi? The most accurate assessment comes courtesy of Han dynasty general Ma Yuan, known as 몬The general who calms the waves.몭 He said this:  몮It is not possible to imitate Cheng Bushi, because trying to make oneself a careful, self-controlled person may end in the same way that attempting to carve a swan may produce something that looks much more like a duck. It is not possible to imitate Li Guang, because one will lower oneself to the station of a frivolous man 멪 this is what is known as trying to draw a tiger and inadvertently drawing something that looks more like a dog.몯
Sima Guang also commented: 몮If one imitates Bushi, one may not achieve great merit, yet one will not suffer defeat. If one imitates Li Guang, there are few who would not bring the whole empire crashing down as a result.몯 
The last person who Wang Xi uses as an example is General Zhu Ran, who served as a senior general under Sun Quan during the Three Kingdoms period. Zhu Ran may not have been as famous as General Zhou Yu, but he was a man of high position. He ultimately reached the ranks of Left Grand Marshal and Right Military Advisor, which made him one of the highest-ranking decision-makers in the Eastern Wu military. Over his lifetime, he built a glittering military record, and enjoyed what could be called a good death (at least by the standards of the chaotic era in which he lived), at the age of sixty-eight. Even when he wasn몭t at war, he still beat the drums and drilled his troops every day at dawn and dusk, and he was in the habit of wearing full armor at all times whenever he was in camp, so he몭d be ready to move out at a moment몭s notice. His enemies never knew what he was planning, so every move he made brought positive results.
Stay safe but always be mindful of danger; Practice good governance but be mindful of potential chaos; This is the way to keep danger and chaos from becoming reality. Solve problems every day, and be ready for things to go wrong at any moment, because things inevitably do go wrong; It would be impossible for nothing to ever go wrong. This is exactly what being a leader is about: solving problems and smoothing things out.


The five most dangerous character flaws for leaders

Leadership ability is, to a large extent, a personality type. But, this works both ways 멪 the worst leadership failures generally happen because of some kind of character flaw. As we몭ll cover below, there are five character flaws that are especially dangerous.

몮There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) Cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) A hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) A delicacy of honor, which is sensitive to shame; (5) Over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.몯

Analysis:
There are five character flaws that, for those in leadership positions, are especially dangerous:
1) Having no fear of death. If you blindly put yourself in situations where you have to fight to the death, you몭re going to die at the hands of your enemies.
2) Loving life too much, and being overly fearful of death. If you don몭t accept the fact of death, you몭ll end up an enemy prisoner-of-war.
3) Being prone to extreme anger. If you can몭t handle being provoked, your enemies will use plots to make you angry, so that you come out to fight when you shouldn몭t, and die in the process.
4) Being too precious, and too fond of your reputation. If you can몭t tolerate being bad-mouthed, you몭ll ignore serious risks if you think you몭re doing something to uphold your reputation and clean your name of the filth that your enemies have smeared it with. Because of this, you몭ll fall for your enemy몭s몭 tricks.
5) Being too protective of the common people. This is something your enemies will exploit, either by making you overwork yourself for the sake of protecting people, or by using ordinary people as human shields, so that you can몭t bring yourself to attack.
For someone whose job it is to lead an army, all five of these character flaws are catastrophic. It is important to be alert to them 멪 any time an army is destroyed or a general is killed, it몭s virtually always because of one of these five factors! 


A person몭s character is also their fate

몮There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) Cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) A hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) A delicacy of honor, which is sensitive to shame; (5) Over-solicitude for the people, which exposes him to worry and trouble. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.몯

Analysis:
몮(1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction멞몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮Men possessed of courage but who lack contemplativeness are inevitably prone to desire fighting unto death; they cannot be made to bend or yield, but one traps them in ambushes.몯
If you ever come up against an enemy who몭s hell-bent on fighting a death match with you, don몭t face him head-on. Lure him toward you, set an ambush, and eat him for breakfast.
In The Methods of Sima, there is a line that reads: 몮He who launches himself toward death cannot be victorious.몯 In other words, a general is never going to win if he substitutes a willingness to lead the charge and duel with death for strategic thinking.
Lord Huang Shi, the immortal who according to legend presented the Han dynasty몭s General Zhang Lang with a copy of Jiang Ziya몭s Art of War, once said: 몮Brave men love to exercise their will, and foolish men care not if they die.몯 Brave men like to do things their own way, and are typically unwilling to abandon their plans just because there might be some danger involved. If a man is both brave and foolish, he won몭t care about dying, which makes him blind to any danger that might threaten his life.
Wu Qi once said that when ordinary people discuss what makes a general, they all agree that bravery comes before all else. But, in reality, bravery should only constitute a small part of a general몭s personality make-up. This is because brave men can go to battle without giving it too much thought. Anyone who sends their troops into battle without first having a clear idea of what they need to do to advance their own interests doesn몭t have what it takes to be a general.
When Sun Tzu writes about 몬The Way of the General,몭 he lists the necessary personal qualities in the following order: wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness. But in the writings of the Prussian military theorist, Carl von Clausewitz, he emphasizes courage above everything else. Meanwhile, Wu Qi bluntly said that bravery shouldn몭t represent more than one small part of a general몭s personality make-up.


몮(2) Cowardice, which leads to capture멞몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮One can see a potential gain, yet fails to advance because one is scared.몯
In the same passage of The Methods of Sima that contains the words, 몮He who launches himself toward death cannot be victorious,몯 there is also the line: 몮He who clings to life is filled with many doubts.몯 If you몭re scared of death, you몭re paranoid, you exaggerate dangers and you fear losing what you have. Lacking the will to fight is a disaster for any military commander.
During the time of the Eastern Jin dynasty (317-420 CE), General Huan Xuan usurped the Jin throne and declared himself Emperor. Another Jin general, Liu Yu, raised an army to put down Huan Xuan몭s uprising. Moving up the Yangzi River toward Huan Xuan몭s position, the two sides met at Zhengrong Island, in the middle of the river, and fought a battle there. Liu Yu only had a few thousand troops, while Huan Xuan commanded a much larger force of infantry and cavalry. And yet, Huan Xuan was scared 멪 scared of losing, and scared of dying. He kept a small rowboat tied to his warship so that he몭d be ready to make his escape at any moment. His troops weren몭t blind; they could see he was frightened, and this completely deflated their willingness to fight. When the battle started, the wind was blowing in Liu Yu몭s favor, and he used it to set fire to the enemy fleet. Attacking fast and hard, he crushed Huan Xuan.
Meng Shi comments: 몮Cowardice in a general inevitably gives rise to a desire to return home, and to an unwillingness to personally take part in fighting. This renders soldiers dull of spirit, and causes hesitation at all levels of the army. When your army is in such a state, the enemy can attack swiftly and subdue your forces.몯
There몭s a lot of depth in these words. First, if you몭re cowardly, you몭ll be preoccupied with thoughts of going home, and in the back of your mind you몭ll always be thinking about how you absolutely must make it back alive. There몭s no way you can fight a battle in this state of mind, because there몭s no such thing as a battle where you몭re guaranteed to come out alive. If you want to be certain that you몭ll survive, the only things you can do are run away or surrender.
Nor can you just let your subordinates go to their deaths on the front lines without being prepared to do the same yourself. This is because, as the leader, it was your idea to go to war in the first place. Everyone else in your army is just following your lead; they몭re there to lend you a hand, to help you solve your problems. You can몭t send other people to do something for you if you몭re not prepared to do it yourself, because that means you몭re not needed.
The same principle applies in the modern world: whatever project you몭re working on, you mustn몭t go absent from the front line. If you do, you become disconnected from the situation on the ground, which effects your ability to apply yourself mentally to the project. Once you no longer have your nose to the ground, your ability to lead suffers and grows weaker. In terms of the dynamics of your organization, if you몭re not there by your soldiers몭 side, if you몭re not personally leading them, 몮this renders soldiers dull of spirit, and causes hesitation at all levels of the army.몯 When that happens, 몮the enemy can attack swiftly and subdue your forces.몯


몮(3) A hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults멞몯
Du Mu comments: 몮A 몬hasty temper몭 refers to one who is unyielding and prone to anger; it refers to one who is often hurried, and whose character is not steadfast.몯
Wang Xi comments: 몮In generals, the most precious characteristic is consistency and an even keel; with a hasty temper, one is susceptible to provocation.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮Men who are of hasty temper can be provoked and angered, and in this way, they may be defeated.몯
To be a general, it is important to be naturally calm, steady and stable. If you몭re hotheaded, with a short temper, and blinkered in the way you think, these are character flaws that your enemies will exploit. They몭ll poke you, press your buttons and insult you until you bite down hard on their baited hook.
During the Uprising of the Five Barbarians, which took place during the Sixteen Kingdoms (304-439 CE) period, Yao Xiang of the Qiang ethnic group attacked Huangluo. Fu Sheng of the Former Qin dynasty sent Fu Huangmei and Deng Qiang to deal with the invasion. Meanwhile, Yao Xiang had already built a solid defensive position, where he몭d holed up and was refusing to come out and fight. Deng Qiang said to Huangmei: 몮Yao Xiang is a hard man by nature, and fierce. It will be easy to make him angry. If we make a lot of noise and fanfare, and press straight towards his ramparts, I am sure that he will not tolerate our noise. He몭ll be compelled to come out and show that he몭s stronger than us, and then, after just one battle, he몭ll be our prisoner.몯 Huangmei went along with this plan, and sure enough, Yao Xiang couldn몭t take the provocation. He came storming out to fight in a fury, and ended up getting executed by Huangmei.
Another example would be the case of Li Shimin, who before he became the first Emperor of the Tang dynasty (Emperor Taizong) beheaded the Sui dynasty general Song Laosheng. Song Laosheng headed a force of 20,000 elite troops defending the city of Huoyicheng, and Li Yuan prepared to attack Song몭s position. Li Shimin told Li Yuan that Song Laosheng was brave, but simple-minded 멪 he could definitely be lured out to fight. So, Li Yuan set up an ambush outside the city walls, while Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin led a few dozen cavalry troops to the foot of the city walls, where they began hurling insults at Song Laosheng. As expected, Song Laosheng couldn몭t stand the verbal abuse, and came charging out of the gates at the head of his army. He ran straight into Li Yuan몭s ambush, by which point Li Shimin had already taken control of the city gates, leaving Song with nowhere to run. He was cut down on the battlefield.

몮(4) A delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame멞몯
Here, 몬a delicacy of honor몭 doesn몭t mean the kind of honor that몭s the opposite of corruption. Instead, it몭s the kind of honor that makes people believe in their own purity and perfection. This is about people who have an extreme love for their own image and reputation, and who can몭t tolerate the slightest stain on their good name. This is the kind of person who, if you destroy his reputation, will jump in the Yellow River and still not feel clean. This means two things: 1) He몭ll fight you to the death; 2) He몭s willing to die to prove his purity. He몭ll walk right into your trap, do exactly what you want him to, and he몭ll do this even if he knows perfectly well that you몭re tricking him.
It몭s a massive character flaw to not be able to deal with being bad-mouthed. At the same time, if you몭re always fishing for compliments and praise, and if you몭re motivated by shaping a glowing reputation for yourself, you have a serious problem. That몭s because the more your reputation sparkles and shines, the more you trigger a compulsive reflex in the people around you to throw dirt on your name. Let몭s face it: it hurts the eyes to look at someone so impossibly pure and spotless. That몭s why, in ancient China, there was the concept of 몬a gentleman belittles himself.몭 This essentially meant that by carefully applying some dirt to your image, you take the shine off and make it less painful for others to look at you. It몭s self-effacement as a self-defense mechanism.

몮(5) Over-solicitude for the people, which exposes him to worry and trouble멞몯
The same principle works here as in kidnapping. In movies, when a hero몭s girlfriend is captured, no danger, no matter how deadly, can stop him from coming to her rescue. If a general has great love for the people, the people can be used against him, as hostages. There몭s a well-known story that relates to this, in the classic novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Before the Battle of Red Cliffs, Cao Cao was on the attack against Liu Bei. Liu Bei retreated, but he could only move very slowly because he몭d taken civilians with him, and his focus and attention were drawn to protecting them. So, Cao Cao caught up with him.
However, this trick doesn몭t work on certain people. For example, during the Rebellion of the Seven States (154 BCE), when the rebel army attacked the kingdom of Liang, Liang was placed under enormous strain. The situation was perilous. The King of Liang begged for imperial reinforcements, but Imperial Commander Zhou Yafu completely ignored him, and left him to struggle alone on the brink of the abyss. In fact, Zhou Yafu wanted to wear down the rebel army몭s morale and let them use up their grain rations, and in the end he swept in to the save the day, just when it appeared all was lost. Things had gone exactly according to his plan 멪 the kingdom of Liang survived, the rebel army ran out of grain and retreated, and Zhou Yafu struck just as the enemy had become sluggish and had begun thinking of going home. In one fell swoop, the rebellion was over. But the King of Liang was left with nothing but a deep hatred for Zhou Yafu. In the end, the Commander got all the credit for putting down the rebellion, but it was he who had weathered the ravages of war!
Zhou Yafu didn몭t look out for the King of Liang, but Liu Bang was even more heartless 멪 he didn몭t even take care of his own family. His father, wife and children were all left out in the cold. Xiang Yu captured Liu Bang몭s wife, Lu Hi, as well as his father, who was stripped naked and trussed up on a giant wooden chopping board. Next to the chopping board, Xiang Yu installed a huge cooking pot, and told Liu Bang that if he refused to come out and fight, his father would be boiled alive and his wife would be slaughtered. Liu Bang, standing on his city walls, shouted his reply to Xiang Yu at full volume: 몮You and I are sworn brothers 멪 we made our oaths with King Huai as a witness 멪 so my father is your father. If you intend to make our father into soup, then save a bowl for me. As for my wife 멪 kill her if you wish, it makes no difference to me.몯 Xiang Yu, confronted with such appalling shamelessness, turned purple with fury. And yet, he never did harm Liu Bang몭s family members.
Another time, after being soundly defeated by Xiang Yu, Liu Bang was in a chariot fleeing the scene. Xiahou Ying was at the reigns, and also in the chariot were Liu Bang몭s young son and daughter, the future Emperor Hui and Princess Lu Yuan. With enemy troops closing in from behind, Liu Bang decided that the chariot was moving too slowly because it was overloaded with too many people. So, using his feet, he shunted his son and daughter off the vehicle, planning to continue his getaway as the lone passenger. But, Xiahou Ying immediately stopped the chariot, scooped up the children, and carried on. This happened three more times. Each time that Xiahou Ying plucked the terrified children from the ground, they clung tight to his neck. And Xiahou Ying took his time 멪 he didn몭t lash the horses back up to high speed, but soothed the children until they몭d calmed down a little, before finally speeding the horses on their way. Liu Bang was so furious that he wanted to kill Xiahou Ying there and then, but if he did that, there would be no one to drive the chariot. In the end, everyone on board made it to safety.
People like Liu Bang 멪 who feel no compulsion either to cling to life or veer towards death, never rush things, don몭t have a sparkling reputation to keep shiny, and don몭t love the common people 멪 may well be the most contemptible kind of people to walk the earth. Yet, because of this, they are also unstoppable as war leaders.


Appendix: Complete text of Variation in Tactics

Sun Tzu said: 몮In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces. When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In a desperate position, you must fight. There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must not be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops. The general who does not understand these may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account. There are commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops. The general who does not understand these may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men. Hence in the wise leader몭s plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may have confidence in accomplishing our tasks. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune. Subdue hostile barons by inflicting damage on them; Encumber them with constant engagements; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy몭s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) Cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) A hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) A delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) Over-solicitude for the people, which exposes him to worry and trouble. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation.몯


					Chapter Nine
The Army on the March

Trusting to luck is the worst possible mindset for a decision-maker

Understanding the art of war doesn몭t necessarily mean that you know how to use it, because when the time comes, your state of mind might be different.

Extract from the original text:
몮We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys. Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare. After crossing a river, you should get far away from it. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river he has to cross. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move upstream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.몯

Analysis:
Commenting on The Army on the March, Wang Xi writes: 몮Armies on the move should occupy favourable terrain, and observe the enemy몭s situation.몯 Here, 몬armies on the move몭 includes the various stages of marching, camping and strategically arranging battle lines. Generals on the march should do two things: make good use of favourable terrain, and pay close attention to the enemy몭s situation. So, The Army on the March is about what to take note of in different types of terrain, and the secrets to accurately judging the enemy situation.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Choose that which brings advantage, and then march.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Understand the variations in the nine types of terrain; then, you can select for advantages and march. Hence, this chapter proceeds from Variations in Tactics.몯

몮We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy.몯


The meaning of 몬encamping the army몭 is self-explanatory. 몬Observing signs of the enemy몭 is about watching for clues and signs from the enemy, and using these to shed light on certain questions.
Wang Xi comments: 몮Regarding encamping the enemy, there are four points to consider; regarding observing signs of the enemy, there are thirty-one points to consider.몯 Wang Xi is talking about different methods for camping in four different types of terrain, and how to assess thirty-one different kinds of signals gleaned from observing the enemy.

몮Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys. Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.몯

Here we have the most important things to know about the first terrain type: mountains.
What is there in mountain valleys that몭s useful for an army? Cao Cao comments: 몮It is advantageous to be close to water and grass.몯 In mountain valleys, you can find water sources and grass for feeding livestock. Armies have horses, and horses need grass to eat. Then there are the animals brought along by the army cooks 멪 pigs and sheep.
Li Quan comments: 몮Whenever an army makes camp, it is essential to immediately assign soldiers to guard duty, set livestock out to graze, collect firewood and gather wild vegetables. Then, all will be calm in the camp.몯
During the Later Han dynasty (25-220 CE), there was an uprising of ethnic Qiang people in the Wudu Commandery. General Ma Yuan was sent to deal with the rebels. When he arrived, the Qiang warriors were high up in the mountains, so he occupied a valley, setting up a strong defensive that gave him exclusive access to the area몭s water and grass. And then, he refused to come out to fight. The Qiang warriors were in a dire situation 멪 their water supply was cut off and their food stores dwindling 멪 and so, they surrendered.

몮Camp in high places, facing the sun.몯

몬Facing the sun몭 also means 몬facing south몭 in this context.
So, to 몬Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys몭 means that, although you should stay close to the valleys, you mustn몭t camp in valley bottoms. Instead, camp somewhere high up, facing the sun. In high places, your field of vision opens up, which makes it easier to defend your camp. If you camp in a valley, it몭s easy for the enemy to surround you, and to attack you from above.
The reason we몭re told to specifically select campsites facing the sun is because they몭re drier, warmer and more comfortable. And, in these places, it몭s not so easy for disease to spread. In shady, damp locations, it몭s easy for soldiers to catch colds, and due to the lack of medicine in ancient times, a rampant flu might lead to a large number of deaths. Napoleon once said that no war, no matter how brutal, has as negative an effect on an army몭s morale as an unhygienic camp. It몭s a much grimmer scenario to lose soldiers to an epidemic, away from the battlefield, than it is to lose them in combat. That몭s because in a battle, at least the enemy is losing soldiers at the same time you are. But disease can decimate your army while completely ignoring the enemy.
We just talked about how Ma Yuan몭s occupation of favourable terrain caused serious problems for the Qiang rebels, which ultimately led to their downfall. But earlier in the book, we also learned about the final battle of Ma Yuan몭s career. He was leading a campaign in Hunan to put down a rebellion of the Miao people, and his risky decision to lead his army forward via a river led to him being stranded in a deep valley, hemmed in by high mountains and dense vegetation. His camp on the riverbank was damp and far removed from the sun. Pinned down by enemy attacks from high above, and facing a disease outbreak, his own life came to an end when he fell prey to the contagion. Was Ma Yuan aware of the dangers when he made that fateful decision? Of course he was 멪 crystal clear. But he was also old, and he knew that this campaign would be his last chance to earn a glorious place in the history books. He didn몭t care about danger or whether he몭d come out alive; he intended to take his chances. This is a different kind of mentality, and it represents the first of the 몬five dangerous faults which may effect a general몭 from the previous chapter. Namely, 몮Recklessness, which leads to destruction.몯 There몭s no doubt that he would have been able to recite this line from memory. The reason he disobeyed it was that he몭d given himself over to the worst of all mindsets that a decision-maker can have: trusting to luck. 
Trusting to luck is a mentality that effects all of us, and often. That몭s why it몭s important to check our state of mind before making decisions. Ask yourself, 몬By making this decision, is there any part of me that몭s taking a chance?몭

몮Do not climb heights in order to fight.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮If I occupy a lower position, then I may not move uphill to attack, and neither may I face an enemy attack if they come from above.몯
You몭ll always come off second best if you try to attack uphill. Don몭t even try it.

몮So much for mountain warfare.몯

The lines above contain all the information needed to properly handle moving armies, camping and fighting in mountainous terrain.

The art of war in marine combat is the same as fighting on land

Extract from the original text:
몮After crossing a river, you should get far away from it. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river that he has to cross. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.몯

Analysis:
몮When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river that he has to cross.몯
When an enemy army crosses a river on its way to attack you, before anything else, you need to choose a place far away from the river to set up your battle lines. Don몭t hover near the river, and don몭t stand in the river waiting for the enemy to come. Instead, wait until only half of their forces have crossed, and then strike.
So, Sun Tzu몭s methods for fighting marine battles are the same as his methods for fighting on dry land. The only difference is that if you fight all your battle on the water, you몭re leading a navy, and not an army.
The reason you shouldn몭t deploy in battle formation directly on a riverbank is that although this enables you to stop the enemy from crossing the river, if they don몭t actually cross, you won몭t have a chance to beat them.
So, abandon your position on the riverbank and draw the enemy across the river. Once they몭ve begun crossing, don몭t wait in the middle of the river for them to attack 멪 wait until half of their forces have crossed, and then strike. This way, the enemy army will only be able to commit half of its troops to the fight, and you also benefit from the fact that they몭re on low ground (the river bank), while you can charge down from higher ground.
This is all quite different from how we normally imagine launching and defending against amphibious attacks. For example, if during the Normandy landing on D-Day, the German army hadn몭t tried to hold a defensive position on the coast, but had instead waited for the Allied forces to be 몬halfway landed몭 멪 and then launched an offensive 멪 that day in history would have taken an unimaginably different course. That몭s why there몭s a pre-condition for this approach to fighting: it only applies 몬If you are anxious to fight.몭 This is only for generals whose goal is annihilate their enemy in battle, and not for generals whose main objective is to defend.


Duke Xiang of Song몭s attempt to model himself after Duke Huan was absurd, not 몬Benevolent몭

Extract from the original text:
몮When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.

So much for river warfare.몯

Analysis:
In Du Mu몭s commentary on these lines, he writes about a historical episode from the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 CE).
While General Guo Huai of the kingdom of Wei held a position in the city of Hanzhong, Liu Bei and his army were on the other side of the Han River, planning to cross and attack Guo Huai. Guo Huai몭s junior officers all considered Liu Bei a formidable warrior, and on top of that, he also had superior numbers. Therefore, they advised Guo Huai to set up battle lines along the riverbank, stopping Liu Bei from crossing. But Guo Huai disagreed: 몮You are all wrong. By clinging to the riverbank we would be showing weakness, and Liu Bei would know immediately that we were scared to fight him. Knowing this, he would be emboldened to cross the river regardless. It is better to deploy our forces at a distance from the river, thus enticing him to cross. Then, while only half of his forces have crossed, we will strike.몯 And so, Guo Huai deployed his forces far from the river. On the far bank, Liu Bei saw what was happening, and knew exactly what trick Guo Huai was planning. He knew better than to try to cross, and instead he withdrew his army.
After the death of Duke Huan of Qi in 643 BCE, during the Spring and Autumn period, the lands of China no longer had a single, undisputed ruler. Duke Xiang of Song had ambitions to take up the late Duke Huan몭s mantle, but he lacked the power to do so. So, he tried to fashion himself as a new Duke Huan, trumpeting his 몬benevolence몭 in the hope that this would be enough to convince all the people of China to bend the knee to him. In the attempt, Duke Xiang left us with a big, historical joke 멪 the battle of the River Hong.
With his ambition to become undisputed ruler of the known world, Duke Xiang decided to start with the easiest target: he went on the warpath against the feeble kingdom of Zheng. Zheng requested help from the kingdom of Chu, which immediately sent out an army to attack the kingdom of Song. Duke Xiang, seeing that he had a serious situation on his hands, called his armies back and dug in at a defensive position by the River Hong, where the Chu and Song armies eventually clashed.
The Chu forces had yet to cross the river, but meanwhile, on the far side, the Song army was already deployed in battle formation. The Song Minister of War, Gong Sungu, tried to give Duke Xiang some advice: 몮The enemy몭s men are many, while we are few; we should strike when they are in the midst of crossing.몯 But Duke Xiang didn몭t agree. Claiming that he was a 몬benevolent몭 commander, he said: 몮I shall not impel the enemy to a perilous position, and I shall not force them into distress.몯
So, the Chu army crossed the river safely and began to deploy in battle formation. Again, Gong Sungu pled with Duke Xiang to take advantage of the enemy몭s temporary disorderliness and attack, but Duke Xiang wouldn몭t allow it. 몮They are not yet beating their drums, and they have not yet formed up in their ranks,몯 he said. Only after the Chu soldiers had finished lining up did he finally give the order to attack. His whole army was annihilated, and he himself sustained a fatal injury. And that was the end of Duke Xiang of Song몭s dreams of ruling the entire world.
People often laugh at what they call 몬Duke Xiang몭s pig-headed benevolence.몭 At the same time, they lament the loss of the 몬traditional chivalry of war몭 that came after the time of the first three of China몭s dynasties, the Xia, Shang and Zhou. 몬Benevolence is dead and buried,몭 people sigh, 몬and skullduggery stands in its place.몭
But, in reality, Duke Xiang wasn몭t the slightest bit 몬benevolent.몭 He was just a classic nobleman, full of dreams of restoring his ancestors몭 glory. The rulers of Song were descended from the former royal house of Shang, confined to the land of Song after the new Zhou dynasty destroyed the final Shang ruler. When Duke Huan of Qi died, Duke Xiang thought it should be his turn to rule the world. But he had lived his whole life deep inside palace chambers, in the hands of women. He몭d never left the palace, and he had no idea what the world was like, let alone the intricacies of politics and war. He knew that he didn몭t have military power, but the way he saw it, 몬benevolence몭 was what enabled Duke Huan of Qi to rule the world. And so, he felt, all he had to do was possess 몬benevolence몭 and the world would raise him up and name him Undisputed Sovereign.
Nobody else was buying it, especially not the leaders of Chu, who kidnapped Duke Xiang during a meeting he몭d called in the hope of launching a new alliance. It was only after the rulers of Lu spoke on his behalf that Chu let him go home. He몭d been humiliated by Chu, yet he was too scared to take his revenge. And so, instead, he tried to vent his anger on Chu몭s 몬little brother,몭 the state of Zheng. Chu then attacked him, and the whole absurd farce that was the Battle of the River Hong unfolded.
There was nothing at all 몬benevolent몭 about Duke Xiang of Song. Even describing him as an idiot would be over-selling him 멪 he was nothing less than absurd.


The problem with studying The Art of War is that the enemy understands it, too; The problem with studying game theory is that the enemy doesn몭t understand it

The art of war is about winning. But, if the enemy also understands the art of war, that makes it difficult to win. In game theory, everyone can win. This means that if you calculate the optimum outcome for both sides, but your enemy doesn몭t understand how it works, they몭ll end up dragging you down with them and you몭ll both suffer damage.

Extract from the original text:
몮After crossing a river, you should get far away from it. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river he has to cross. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.몯

Analysis:
When Liu Bei saw that Guo Huai had lined up his army far away from the river, he didn몭t dare try to cross. A similar scenario played out in the early years of the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE), but there was an opposite outcome.
Generals Xue Wanjun and Luo Yi were defending Youyan when Dou Jiande attacked the area of Fanyang, at the head of an army of several hundred thousand men. Xue Wanjun said to Luo Yi: 몮We are outnumbered 멪 if we go out to fight, even if we fought a hundred different battles, we would be defeated each time. Our only option is to subdue the enemy by trickery. We should send a detachment of our weakest soldiers to the river in front of the city to block Dou몭s passage. Thus, Dou will be enticed into crossing the river. Meanwhile, you will lay in ambush on the enemy몭s flank with several hundred elite warriors, and once half of the enemy forces have crossed, that is when you will strike.몯
Luo Yi went along with the plan, and sure enough, Dou Jiande crossed. Luo Yi attacked precisely when half of the enemy troops had crossed, and inflicted a massive defeat. 
Zhang Yu comments: 몮If rebel soldiers move their forces across a waterway in order to join battle on the far side, you must not meet them at the water몭s edge. Wait until half of the enemy forces have crossed, and then move while their ranks are not yet settled and their head and tail detached; if you strike then, you are sure to be victorious.몯


몮If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river he has to cross.몯

If you몭re looking to engage the enemy in combat, don몭t deploy your forces at the water몭s edge and think they몭ll come to you; they won몭t. 
Zhang Yu comments: 몮If I wish to be certain that battle will be joined, then I must not await the enemy near to the water, for fear that he will not cross. Conversely, if I do not wish to fight, then I must obstruct his passage across the water, so that it is impossible for him to cross.몯
However, given that both sides understand this principle, it몭s actually used in reverse, as in the historical examples above. Guo Huai didn몭t want a fight with Liu Bei, and he knew exactly what to do: according to the art of war, if you don몭t want to fight, you should deploy at the river몭s edge so as to block the enemy from crossing. But Guo Huai knew that Liu Bei was familiar with this tactic, meaning that if he followed the art of war and lined up by the river, Liu Bei would recognize this as a sign that Guo Huai was weak, reluctant to fight, and would then do the exact opposite of what Guo Huai wanted, crossing the river and attacking. Then, there would be no guarantee that Guo Huai몭s limited battle capabilities would be able to hold off the enemy. But, if Guo Huai chose to form up at a distance from the river, then according to the art of war, Liu Bei should take this as a sign that Guo Huai had a powerful enough army to feel confident, that he wanted to fight, and that if Liu Bei tried to cross, Guo Huai would attack before all his forces reached the far side. So, Liu Bei decided he couldn몭t take the risk of attacking.
In the end, Guo Huai몭s gamble paid off 멪 he forced an error of judgment from Liu Bei.
Zhang Yu also wrote about another interesting episode from Chinese military history, from the Spring and Autumn period. During a war between the states of Jin and Chu, the forces of Jin commander Yang Chufu and Chu commander Zi Shang came head-to-head at the River Zhi. Yang Chufu wanted to make the Chu army cross the river, so he could attack while only half their army had crossed. He pulled his army back some way from the river and set up camp. Meanwhile, Zi Shang had the same idea: wanting to lure the Jin army across the river, he also pulled his army back and set up camp away from the river. Both generals were thinking in exactly the same way, so neither was fooled by the other몭s plan. Both sides kept retreating, further and further away, until it became clear that nothing was going to happen. At that point, both sides packed up and headed home.
This is why the problem with studying the art of war is that the enemy understands it, too. By contrast, with game theory, problems happen when the enemy doesn몭t understand it. The art of war is about winning, but if the enemy also understands the art of war, that makes it difficult to win. In game theory, everyone can win. This means that if your enemy doesn몭t understand game theory,  even if you calculate the optimum outcome for both sides, if your enemy doesn몭t understand how it works, they몭ll end up dragging you down with them, and you몭ll both take damage.
It몭s a common saying in Chinese that 몬Circumstances are more powerful than mortal men.몭 So, if you몭re faced with circumstances where both you and your enemy are taking damage, why not team up instead? And yet, your opponent likely has a different assessment of the circumstances than you do. If he thinks he can win, all you can do is walk with him down the road of defeat.

몮Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun.몯

Earlier, we talked about how, in mountainous terrain, it몭s important to 몬camp in high places, facing the sun,몭 and the same principle applies when you몭re near bodies of water. 
Cao Cao comments: 몮On water also, one should position oneself up high; face the water, and keep your backs to the high terrain.몯
We몭ve already talked about why you should choose a position facing the sun 멪 these places are drier, more hygienic and less prone to outbreaks of disease.
There are three good reasons to position yourself in high places. First, you have a broader field of vision, which helps you monitor the enemy몭s situation. Second, the enemy won몭t be able to flood you out, and you몭ll be safe from flash floods if there몭s an overnight rainstorm. Third, if the enemy tries a surprise attack, starting from a higher position will tilt the balance of power and energy in your favor.

몮Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮For fear of being flooded.몯 Here, Cao Cao is referring to being flooded out of one몭s camp by the enemy. The same meaning applies as in 몬moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun.몭
Jia Lin comments: 몮In areas with flowing water, the enemy may flood my army, or he may release poisonous substances in the water.몯 Poison is another potential danger.
Zhuge Liang once said: 몮In waterborne combat, one must not try to move counter to the current.몯 Whichever side is moving with the current holds an advantage 멪 a big advantage. If you try to move upstream to attack an enemy, you몭re fighting against the current as well as against your enemies, leaving you with very poor odds of victory. This is why the cities of Xiangyang and Anqing were key strategic locations throughout history; any general who takes Xiangyang or Anqing would have free movement downriver, making it effectively impossible to stop them from taking Nanjing.

몮So much for river warfare.몯

This concludes the section about applying the art of war to marine warfare.
The art of using military force in salt marshes and on open plains

Extract from the original text:
몮In crossing salt marshes and swamps, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay. If forced to fight in a salt marsh or a swamp, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt marshes. In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country. These are the four useful branches of military knowledge that enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four sovereigns. All armies prefer high ground to low, and sunny places to dark. If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.몯

Analysis:
Chen Hao comments: 몮Salt marshes are areas of alkaline land, where both water and grass are of coarse quality, and they are so imbued with damp that they are not suitable places to position an army. In The Xin Xun, it is written that 몬in areas of salt marshes and swamps, the five grains cannot grow.몭 This is true.몯
Wang Xi comments: 몮Salt marshes are alkaline places, characterized by open, sunken land, and by a lack of secure places.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮On account of damp and humid vapor possessed by the earth in such places, and of the sparse and coarse water and grasses, one should make haste to pass through.몯
In these comments, we have four major threats posed by salt marshes:
1) 몬The five grains몭 cannot grow, meaning there is no food and no opportunity to re-supply.
2) Water and local grass species are sparse and of poor quality, meaning these are challenging places in which to encamp.
3) The terrain is open and low, meaning there are no easily defendable places, and making it difficult to build defensive structures.
4) The air is damp and humid, making it easy for disease to spread.
Hence, 몬Your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay.몭 In these lines, we can find the source of the difficulties faced by the Communist Red Army while crossing grassy areas during the Long March.


몮If forced to fight in a salt marsh or a swamp, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees.몯

If you몭re going to be in a damp, marshy area, it몭s essential that you find somewhere with a fresh water source. Without access to fresh drinking water, an army won몭t last long in a salt marsh.
There are two benefits to positioning yourself up against trees: 1) Nobody will be able to come at you from behind, so at least it will be impossible for an enemy force to surround you on all four sides; 2) In marshland, it몭s impossible to know how shallow or deep the bog in front of you might be. With each step you take, you face the possibility that you몭ll sink irretrievably into a deep swamp, like hapless Red Army soldiers in war movies, swallowed whole as they walk across the marshlands. The same thing can happen in deserts 멪 in certain spots there are deep pits of loose sand that are impossible to climb out of once you fall in. All you can do is wait as you slowly sink deeper, and are eventually buried by the sand. If you fall in, you몭re not the only person in danger; anyone who tries to pull you out risks being sucked in with you. Wherever there are trees, you know the ground is relatively solid, so you don몭t have to face this danger.
Li Quan mentions this danger in his commentary: 몮If it is impossible to cross quickly, and if one must fight, it is essential to find a position with water, and with trees with which to shield one몭s back. In any place with water and trees, there is no danger of becoming trapped and drowning.몯 If it몭s not possible to quickly cross a marsh 멪 for example, because it몭s too big to cross in a single day 멪 it몭s necessary to find a place with water and trees to camp and prepare for the eventuality of engaging in battle.

몮So much for operations in salt marshes.몯

This concludes the part about strategies for leading armies in salt marshes.

몮In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮Flat land 멪 one must choose a place that is flat, level and provides easy access, and position one몭s army there. Thus, one몭s chariots and cavalry are able to move at speed.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮It is beneficial for chariots and cavalry.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Level, open wildernesses are places for chariots and cavalry; one must choose a position that is level, easily accessible, and devoid of pits and holes, and station one몭s army there. This is beneficial to moving at high speed.몯
In ancient times, the Chinese didn몭t rely only on the Great Wall to stop the northern nomadic people from launching raids to the south. They also planted massive numbers of trees on the open plains, because the armies of the northern Xiongnu were built around cavalry, while Chinese armies mainly used infantry forces. The idea behind planting trees was to slow down the speed at which the Xiongnu could travel; otherwise, the pounding hooves of the northern cavalry would have been able to carry invading armies deep into China.

몮멞 with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind.몯

While you should choose a flat place with easy access, that doesn몭t mean your base should be surrounded by flat ground on all sides. If all around you there몭s nothing but flat land, you would be exposed to the enemy on all sides. In the ideal scenario, you would have high land to your right and to your rear, and flat land to your left. This gives you a protective barrier to shield your back, and flat terrain in front so that you can take the fight to the enemy. The meaning of 몬danger in front, and safety behind몭 is that the battlefield, the place of death, should be out in front, and behind you there should be mountains 멪 a place without danger, a place of life. This puts you in a good position to fight.
So, whichever side reaches the battlefield first, and claims the best terrain, gets a major boost to their odds of victory.
Cao Cao comments: 몮This is beneficial for fighting.몯 In other words, setting yourself up like this makes things more convenient.
But why should the high land be on the right, and not on the left?
Li Quan comments: 몮In all things which a man might make use of, it is most convenient to use the right; hence, one should face away from the right.몯 An estimated 90% of people worldwide are right-handed; they do everything with their right hand. For example, when holding a long gun, most use their left hand to hold the front and their right hand to hold the back. Hence, the right side is, for the vast majority of people, the side of convenience.
Jia Lin comments: 몮Hillocks and mounds are here called 몬life,몭 and battlefields are here called 몬death.몭 With hillocks or mounds to your rear, your army occupies a stable position; with the battlefield positioned in front, one is conveniently positioned to deploy one몭s army; with high land to the right, it is expedient to turn around.몯
For example, if you shout an order, 몬Turn to the right,몭 everyone will turn in the clockwise direction, but some might mistakenly turn to the left. If that happens, everyone will laugh and make fun of them.
Jiang Ziya once said: 몮One몭s army must be positioned with rivers or swamps to the left, and hills to the right.몯 This is the best of all possible worlds 멪 you have everything you need, and the enemy only has one approach route, which makes the task of defending your position much easier.


몮So much for campaigning in flat country.몯

This concludes the section on leading armies in flat terrain.

몮These are the four useful branches of military knowledge which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish the four sovereigns.몯

We몭ve now reached the conclusion of this part on terrain, where Sun Tzu wraps up the sections on how to use military force in mountainous, watery, swampy and flat terrain.
Zhuge Liang once said: 몮When fighting in mountainous country, do not climb to fight the enemy at a higher elevation; when fighting upon water, do not move counter to the current; when fighting in marshland, do not wade into the depths; when fighting in flat country, do not leave yourself exposed at the rear.몯
These are the four principles the Yellow Emperor used to defeat the four feudal lords of China.
Who were these 몬sovereigns? In the records of the most ancient reaches of Chinese history, there is mention of 몬the Three Emperors and the Five Sovereigns,몭 but there몭s nothing written about 몬the four sovereigns.몭 Cao Cao comments: 몮When the Yellow Emperor first established himself, the sovereigns of the four regions all claimed the title of sovereign.몯 So, 몬sovereign몭 was just a generic word used for feudal lords at the time.
Where did Sun Tzu learn the art of war? Did it just fall from the sky? Did he come up with it entirely by himself? In fact, it was none of the above. He worked in the same way as Confucius, who said: 몮I expound, rather than create.몯 Sun Tzu just offered explanations of what he몭d learned from the ancient thinkers who came before him; he didn몭t create anything new.
Every version of The Art of War that exists traces its origins to the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor몭s treatise was written about his top general, Feng Hou. We몭ve already discussed the principle of 몬Using the regular to engage the enemy, and the irregular to defeat him.몭 This idea originally came from Writings on Grasping the Irregular, part of Feng Hou몭s writings on the art of war. It then passed from the Yellow Emperor down to Jiang Ziya, and from Jiang Ziya to Sun Tzu, who finally compiled the entirety of China몭s military wisdom in his book, The Art of War. This book has, from ancient times until today, always kept its place at the cutting edge of each historical era몭s military strategy and thinking.
The famous British strategist, BH Liddell Hart, once commented: 몮There are only two books of military strategy in this world, which surpass all the strategies contained in all other books of military lore. Those two books are Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War and Clausewitz몭s On War, and the latter is outdated when compared with Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War.몯
On War came into the world more than 2,000 years after Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, yet here Liddell Hart claims that On War is outdated, while The Art of War represents the forefront of military thinking. If you want to know the true value of Sun Tzu몭s masterwork, look no further.

몮All armies prefer high ground to low and yang (sunny) places to yin (dark). If you take care of your men, and place yourself in a position of strength, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the yang side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.몯

And with that, let몭s do one last summary.
Whenever it comes time to find a campsite for your army, always choose high, dry terrain, and stay well clear of damp, low-lying ground. Orient yourself towards yang, and don몭t back yourself up against yin.
몬Taking care of your men몭 means staying close to fresh water and grass. This makes it easy to graze the army몭s war horses, cattle and sheep, to find food for the pigs, to fetch water and firewood, and to maintain open supply lines.
몬Placing yourself in a position of strength몭 means occupying the high ground, with mountains covering your back 멪  this is a strong position. If you back up against empty space, leaving your rear unprotected, your position is weak.
If you 몬take care of your men and place yourself in a position of strength몭 you are safeguarding your army몭s vital necessities. You have the security of a natural barrier protecting your rear, so you don몭t have to worry about being attacked from behind, and you keep one side open so that you can press the enemy.  If you camp high up, facing the sun, taking care of your men and putting yourself in a strong position, disease won몭t spread easily through your army. This is the only way to keep your army몭s battle capabilities sharp; this is how to guarantee victory.

몮When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮Whenever encountering hills or banks, one should occupy the southeastern side.몯
So, selecting a military campsite is more or less the same as buying a house 멪 if you want to be safe and comfortable, you have to carefully choose a place with the right orientation.
Wang Xi comments: 몮Positioned in yang, people are able to live in comfort and harmony; this is beneficial to nurturing health and talent[bd29][TT30].몯


Sun Tzu teaches a life-saving lesson to backpackers from The Art of War

Extract from the original text:
몮When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.몯

Analysis:
If you몭re trying to cross a river and you see that the water is brown with mud and has bubbles on the surface, this means there몭s been a lot of rain upriver, and it몭s possible that the water level is about to surge upwards. If you see these signs and still try to cross, it몭s possible that the river will swell while you몭re still crossing. If that happens, you might drown. Don몭t cross; wait for a while. When the river surface shows signs of calming down and the flow stabilizes, then you can cross.
I regularly see news reports about water released from an upstream reservoir, resulting in death by drowning at points downstream. The only effect of these reports is to rouse public fury, but nobody comes out with a technical solution for the problem. Why isn몭t it possible to release signals into the river before releasing reservoir water? For example, you could start by releasing only a small amount of water, and at the same time put red floating balls into the stream to warn people downstream. These balls could be released in batches, every ten minutes, and after an hour the full water release would officially commence. Wouldn몭t this give people downstream time to prepare? Otherwise, if you just continue the old policy of sending out notifications in downstream villages, there will always be people who don몭t get the news in time. Then, when the deluge comes barreling down the river, lives are lost.
For those of us who enjoy outdoor pursuits, this part of The Art of War is very useful. It몭s not unheard of for hikers to camp next to rivers, only for flash floods to come down from the mountains and drown them in the night. This kind of tragic event has happened at the foot of Ali Mountain in Taiwan 멪 tourists were fishing on a riverbank when a flash flood came down from upstream, causing the water level to surge. Search and rescue personnel made it to the scene, as well as television broadcasting trucks, but they were unable to save the stranded tourists, who ended up drowning on live television.
Make sure you remember this line from Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: if you see river water turning muddy and starting to bubble, that means it몭s raining upstream, and the water level is liable to shoot up suddenly. At least there몭s one difference between flood surges caused by rain and those caused by reservoirs dumping water into rivers 멪 with natural floods, there몭s generally time to escape.


Six dangerous types of terrain

Extract from the original text:
몮Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses should be left with all possible speed and not approached. While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.몯

Analysis:
These are the six dangerous types of terrain, which we should never get too close to.
Mei Yaochen comments about 몬precipitous cliffs with torrents running between몭 that are 몬dangerously steep all around, with water rushing about.몭
Cao Cao comments: 몮몬Precipitous cliffs with torrents running between몭 refers to places of deep mountains and large waterways.몯
Basically, it몭s about places with deep ravines with large waterways flowing through, which are impassable.
About 몬deep natural hollows,몭 Mei Yaochen says that these are 몮dangerously steep on four sides; places to which ravines and canyons lead.몯
Cao Cao identifies these places as having 몮high walls in all directions, with a hollow below in the center.몯
Du Mu quotes from another ancient text, the Jun Shi: 몮Terrain characterized by cavities, where large waterways flow; such places are called 몬heavenly wells.몭몯
These places are deep holes with water at the bottom. Basically, they몭re massive, natural wells.
About 몬confined places,몭 Mei Yaochen states that they are 몮blocked on three sides; easy to enter, but difficult to exit.몯몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮Places which are passed through in deep mountain terrain; for those who are not diligent, they become 몬natural prisons.몭몯
Du Mu comments: 몮Oppressively narrow mountain ravines, which can stop people몭s forward progress; such places are called 몬natural prisons.몭몯
Here, we have different explanations from three commentators. In Eleven Commentaries on Sun Tzu몭s Art of War, Mei Yaochen몭s explanation is considered the correct one. In a 몬confined place,몭 the way forward is blocked off on three sides, and although it몭s possible to enter on one side, once you몭re inside it몭s impossible to get back out.
About 몬tangled thickets,몭 Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Places where grasses and trees grow dense, such that neither spear nor arrow may be deployed.몯
This is about places where the vegetation is so thick and movement so difficult that there몭s no space to wave a sword or a spear, or even to fire an arrow. It몭s just like in golf, when you몭re in a stand of trees and you don몭t have space to swing your club.
About 몬quagmires,몭 Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Muddy, low-lying terrain, impassable for chariots, carts and cavalry.몯
These places are 몬natural traps.몭
About 몬crevasses,몭 Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Two mountains facing one another, forming a cave-like passage; narrow and loathsome.몯
This is the same geographical feature that is found in so many scenic sites in China, beloved by tourists and known in modern Chinese as 몬a crack of sky.몭 But although these places make for fun tourist destinations, they몭re much less fun for armies on the march in wartime. It몭s bad luck to have to take an army through such places.

몮멞 (such places) should be left with all possible speed and not approached.몯

If you encounter any of these six types of terrain, it몭s important to leave as quickly as possible. Better yet, don몭t even get close in the first place.

몮While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.몯

As we stay far away from these places, we can draw our enemies to them. If we engage our enemy near these types of terrain, the arrangement most favourable for us is for our army to be facing the dangerous terrain, while the enemy fights with their back to it.
Cao Cao comments: 몮In war, we always stay far away from the six dangers, while causing the enemy to draw close to them and to face away from them; thus, I benefit and the enemy is in danger.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮This passage tells us that, when encountering these six dangerous types of terrain, I should stay far away while facing the dangerous terrain, allowing me the freedom to advance and to halt as I will; the enemy should be made to draw near to the dangerous terrain and to face away from it, thus creating a barrier to his movements. Thus, this is beneficial to me and dangerous to my enemy.몯
So, in war, the key is to seize control of the best terrain. And, if you encounter any of the six dangerous types of terrain, keep your distance while still facing it, wait for the enemy to arrive, and then force him into the dangerous terrain.


Thirty-two methods for monitoring the enemy몭s condition (part one)

Extract from the original text:
몮If an army on the march should encounter any steep and obstructed terrain, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking. When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position. When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance. If his place of encampment is easy of access, he holds an advantage. Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing. The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious. The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that the enemy is surging forth. When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry. When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.몯

Analysis:
몮If an army on the march should encounter any steep and obstructed terrain, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮What is meant by 몬steep몭 is terrain with abrupt transitions between high and low land; what is meant by 몬obstructed몭 is terrain with large amounts of water; thick undergrowth can be used as a natural screen.몯
Next, we몭ll go through the various ways you can observe the enemy. The Art of War discusses a total of 32 such observational techniques:

1) 몮When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.몯

This is when the enemy is in close proximity to your army, but shows no signs of moving. They have control of the best terrain, terrain that is dangerous for you to approach. So, they feel secure, without fear. Here, 몬quiet몭 is used in the sense of 몬motionless.몭 It doesn몭t necessarily mean that the enemy isn몭t making any noise. In a historical example from a previous chapter 멪 the one about General Ma Yuan몭s expedition in Hunan against the rebellious Miao people 멪 Ma Yuan became stranded on a riverbank. The Miao fighters stood on the high cliffs above the river ravine and subjected Ma Yuan to a deafening racket, because they knew there was no way he could climb up to where they were. He was completely helpless.


2. 몮When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance.몯

This is when the enemy stays far away from your army and sends a small force to lure you into a fight. Their aim is to tempt you into moving forward, towards them.

This is the exact opposite of the previous line. Rather than staying put, secure in the knowledge that their position is strong, here the enemy forces move over a great distance to pick a fight with you, as an attempt to provoke you into moving towards their main force.
In the Wei Liaozi, there몭s a passage that reads: 몮When the enemy has the distribution of dangerous terrain, do not commit your heart to battle. When the enemy challenges you to fight, do not commit your full energy to fighting.몯 If the enemy takes control of dangerous terrain before you do, don몭t try to make a fight happen. If the enemy is deployed far away from you, and sends soldiers to pick a fight, don몭t hit him with your full force. Leave some units in reserve, and watch how the battle unfolds.

3. 몮If his place of encampment is easy of access, he holds an advantage.몯

If the enemy has taken up a position in open country, he definitely has a terrain advantage, and he몭ll want to lure you towards him and finish you.

Zhang Yu comments: 몮When the enemy spurns dangerous terrain and positions himself in easy terrain, it is certain that he has derived some advantage.몯 This means the enemy isn몭t even slightly scared of you; he몭s just waiting for you to come to him so he can put you to the sword. In this situation, you need to play it cautiously. The principle here is roughly the same as the passage, 몬refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order; refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array,몭 which appears in Chapter Seven, Armed Struggle.

4. 몮Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing.몯

If you see tree branches moving, that means the enemy is on their way towards you.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮It is vital, in an army, to send a man skilled in observation to climb high points and monitor the enemy. If he sees movement among trees, this means the enemy is cutting down trees to clear a path; he is coming. It is also possible that they are not just clearing a path, but also preparing to craft weapons.몯

When a large army is on the move, it needs to cut down trees as it goes to clear its path forward, and it몭s also possible that they are using the wood of these trees to make weapons and build structures for their camp. To sum up, if you see trees swaying about, this is a sign that the enemy is coming.

5. 몮The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮If the enemy makes bundles of grass to use as screens, he wishes to sow doubt in my mind.몯

If the enemy is setting up barriers in dense areas of grass, what he몭s doing is setting up a diversion. In fact, he might already have fled the area.

Du Mu comments: 몮This passage tells us: either the enemy has not yet completed construction of defensive fortifications at his camp, or he has removed his army from the areas and has secretly departed, and, fearing that we may pursue him, he has deployed bundles of grass about the place as if there were people concealed behind, in order that we would feel misgivings and not dare to approach.몯

6. 몮The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Where you see birds rising upwards, there are troops hiding in ambush below.몯

Zhang Yu몭s commentary gives a more vivid image: 몮When you see birds flying horizontal to the ground, and then, having arrived at an enemy position, suddenly fly upwards, this shows there are enemy soldiers lying in ambush below.몯

7. 몮Startled beasts indicate that the enemy is surging forth.몯

Chen Hao comments: 몮What is meant by 몬surging forth몭 is that the enemy is hidden in the woods, and will drive forth to attack you.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮The enemy battle lines are vast and widely spread, and they are surging forth to attack.몯

몬Surging forth몭 has two meanings. First, it means the enemy is hiding in the woods and is about to launch a surprise attack. Second, it means that 몬the enemy battle lines are vast and widely spread몭 멪 they have a lot of troops, and they will attack over a wide area. So, when you see wild animals running from the woods because they have nowhere left to hide among the trees, then you have a serious problem on your hands!

8.  몮When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing멞몯

When you see dust rising high in the sky in a narrow column, that means enemy chariots are on their way.

Zhang Yu comments: 몮Chariots and horses moving at high speed and in large numbers, when they move in formation and follow precisely in the tracks of those before them, then dust rises high and straight.몯

9. 몮When the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry.몯

War chariots move in tight lines, each line following precisely the one in front, which is why the dust they produce forms narrow columns. Infantry soldiers, however, move in relatively broad lines, so they kick up wider dust clouds. Also, dust from infantry units doesn몭t rise as high in the sky as dust produced by chariots.

In ancient Chinese warfare, there were people who had the specific duty of observing dust clouds created by enemy armies. At one point during the Three Kingdoms period, Cao Cao was chasing Liu Bei, so Liu Bei몭s ally Zhang Fei sent a cavalry unit out to trick Cao Cao. Each of the unit몭s horses had a tree branch tied to its tail, which they dragged back and forth in an effort to send a huge amount of dust up into the sky. The question is, would Cao Cao have been able to tell that the dust was fake?

10. 몮When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood.몯

When dust is spread out and forms long, narrow columns, this means the enemy soldiers are cutting firewood.

Why does the dust do this? First of all, the reason it몭s spread out is that soldiers on firewood-cutting duty fan out in all directions. Then, when they몭re finished chopping, they drag the wood along the ground back to camp, which is why the dust forms long columns.

Li Quan comments: 몮When the commanders of Jin set out to invade Qi, they ordered men to drag firewood behind their army. From the mountaintops, the men of Qi saw this and were terrified that this signified vast Jin armies. They fled at night.몯


11.  몮A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.몯

Zhang Yu comments: 몮Whenever encamping, it is vital to dispatch light cavalry to travel out in the four directions and inspect the nearby terrain. This is in order to know where the terrain is dangerous or easy, and where it is open or narrow. Hence, there is a small quantity of dust, and it moves here and there.몯


Thirty-two methods for monitoring the enemy몭s condition (part two)

Extract from the original text:
몮Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to attack are signs that he will retreat. When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle. Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot. When there is much running about and the soldiers and chariots fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are in chaos. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. Clamor by night betokens nervousness. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general몭s authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.몯

We will now move on to the next 14 ways outlined in The Art of War for observing the enemy, and interpreting what you see:

 12. 몮Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮The enemy몭s messengers use humble rhetoric; when I send spies to observe the enemy, I learn the enemy is increasing his preparations.몯

The enemy is attempting to make us apathetic and arrogant; while we let down our guard, he몭s preparing to launch his offensive.

In Du Mu몭s comment on this line, he writes about a historical case study we몭ve already seen in previous chapters: Zhao She몭s war to save the city of Yuyu. Zhao She set out with his army from the city of Handan, but after marching only thirty li, he set up camp and halted his troops몭 advance. When the enemy Qin forces sent a messenger to his camp, the man was treated well and given plenty of good food and drink. The Qin commander, it seems, believed that Zhao She didn몭t have the courage to attack. As soon as the Qin messenger left the Zhao camp, Zhao She moved out, marching double time until his forces reached the Qin army. He took the enemy unawares and unprepared, and utterly trounced them in battle.

Zhang Yu also writes about a historical case study, in which General Tian Dan defended the city of Jimo while being besieged by General Qi Jie of the state of Yan. As Tian Dan enlisted soldiers for his forces, he even enlisted his wives and concubines, and he personally joined the rank-and-file soldiers in readiness to fight for their city. Once he몭d finished his preparations, he sent a woman up onto the city walls to offer surrender to the enemy outside. Qi Jie received the news with delight.

Tian Dan took 1,000 yi of gold from the people of the city and ordered Jimo몭s richest citizens to take the gold and present it to Qi Jie, and to deliver a message for him: 몮The city is surrendering. I hope that your soldiers will not plunder the city or harm my wives and concubines.몯 Hearing this, the Yan troops relaxed even more.

The next moment, Tian Dan was charging out of the gates with his army. He hit the Yan army hard, routing them in one fell swoop.

Tricks and scams 멪 the truth is that there are really only a handful of variations, and they몭re all well documented in books. Yet, people still fall for them. All you can do is shake your head and sigh: 몬There are too many idiots in this world. Frankly, there aren몭t enough scammers to go around!몭

So, why do people fall for these scams? There몭s a proverb from the west: 몮There are some things that people believe for the sole reason that they want so badly for it to be true.몯

When someone creates an illusion, if that illusion symbolizes a hope or desire you have,  you몭ll believe in it totally. You몭ll go all in, and you몭ll delightedly tell yourself: 몬It몭s happening just the way I thought it would. I몭m not surprised!몭

In the case of the Qin general, he was thinking: 몮Zhao She몭s just a boy; he몭d never dare cross swords with the great Qin army! I always knew there was never any chance he몭d come, and lo and behold, he몭s not coming!몯

And, in the case of the Yan general, Qi Jie, he was thinking: 몮How could Tian Dan ever be a match for me? And I was right 멪 he몭s no match for me! At least you can say this about him: he knows the score. Look, the local magnates are coming out to give me protection money.몯

13. 몮Violent language and driving forward as if to attack are signs that he will retreat.몯

This is the opposite of 몬humble words몭 signaling an imminent attack. If the enemy몭s messengers deliver fiery, aggressive speeches and give the impression that their forces are on the attack, this actually means they몭re about to run away. The belligerent messengers are just sheep in wolves몭 clothing.

Du Mu writes about a historical example of this principle: King Fuchai of Wu몭s northern expedition to tussle for supremacy with Duke Ding of Jin. The two armies몭 paths collided at Huangchi, but before the fighting had even started, King Goujian of Yue invaded Wu, taking advantage of the Wu army몭s absence. Fuchai was spooked. He wanted to withdraw his armies and hurry back home to protect his kingdom, but he felt held back by two concerns. First, considering that his army was lined up opposite the Jin army, he was worried that retreating without a fight would cripple his troops몭 morale. Second, he was worried the Jin forces would chase after him. He called a meeting with his advisors, and asked: 몮Which course of action offers greater advantage 멪 withdrawing without a fight, or fighting in a bid to secure supremacy?몯

Advisor Wang Sunluo said: 몮We must challenge the enemy to fight today, so as to invigorate the men몭s hearts. Only then can we withdraw.몯

So, the King of Wu took 30,000 armored troops and advanced to within one li of the Jin army, lined up in battle formation, and started up a deafening noise. Duke Ding of Jin sent his advisor Dong He to ask King Fuchai, 몮What is the meaning of this?몯 Fuchai granted the messenger a personal audience, and answered his question with hard words: 몮The time has come. If you want to orphan your children or if you want to save yourself trouble, either way, today is the day!몯

Dong He went back to Duke Ding, and told him: 몮When I was observing the King of Wu몭s complexion, it appeared that something of great magnitude is gnawing at his mind. If we engage in battle today, he will hold nothing back in the fight. We cannot fight him.몯 So, Duke Ding of Jin backed off, and agreed to make peace. 

Now Fuchai was on the front foot. He몭d secured a peace agreement and he몭d kept his dignity. He immediately moved his forces back to the home front.

14. 몮When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Forming up battle lines means that the enemy desires battle.몯

The first to come out are the light chariots. This means the enemy is about to form up battle lines and engage. The chariots are sent out to either flank to act as boundary markers for the army. Once they몭re in place, battle flags are planted in specific locations, and each unit assembles behind their flag. This is what happens when the enemy is setting up their battle lines and getting ready to fight.

15.  몮Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.몯

If the enemy says he wants peace but doesn몭t make any solid proposals, don몭t be fooled 멪 he has a trick up his sleeve.

We just talked about how Tian Dan 몬sued for peace몭 with Qi Jie. First, he sent a woman up on the city walls to make himself look weak and to ask for peace. Then, the richest residents of the city went out to offer protection money, and they did so as private citizens. At no point did Tian Dan himself offer specific surrender terms. This proves beyond doubt that he was up to something. If he really wanted to surrender, wouldn몭t he have put some effort into negotiating a price for peace?

The same thing happened when Ji Xin fooled Xiang Yu.

It happened like this: Liu Bang had been surrounded by Xiang Yu몭s forces at Xingyang, and his anxiety was at the boiling point. But his advisor Ji Xin had a clever plan. Since he looked very similar to Liu Bei, he could disguise himself as his lord and come out of the eastern gate to surrender, while the real Liu Bei could escape through the western gate. Liu Bei agreed to give the plan a try. He sent a document of surrender to Xiang Yu, in which he wrote: 몮The King of Han shall this evening come to offer his surrender.몯 Xiang Yu was delighted.

At midnight, a large number of women poured out from the eastern gate, with multiple groups coming out in bursts. The Chu army came forward to encircle the women, to watch and wait for Liu Bang to come out. By the time the last of the women had emerged, the sky was already growing light. Finally, a figure who appeared to be Ji Xin made his way slowly out of the gates, lying down in an imperial chariot. When the Chu troops saw that Liu Bang had come to surrender, they began to shout: 몮Long Live King Xiang,몯 the assembled troops cried. By the time Xiang Yu realized that this 몬Liu Bang몭 was a fake, the real Liu Bang had already fled through the western gate. He was long gone.

Xiang Yu never stopped to wonder why Liu Bang would send a letter announcing he was going to surrender on the same day, without mentioning a single term or condition? It made no sense! But Xiang Yu was a very arrogant man 멪 the way he saw it, it was right and proper that Liu Bang should surrender to him unconditionally.

There was another famous example of this from the reign of Emperor Dezong of the Tang dynasty: the treaty ambush at Pingliang. A leader of the Tibetan Empire, Shang Gyaltsen, was invading Hequ when his army fell prey to a disease outbreak. Half of his men and horses died, and he became worried that he wouldn몭t be able to make it back home. So, he sent a messenger to the camp of the Tang commander, Ma Sui, humbly and politely requesting a meeting to discuss not only signing a peace treaty, but forming an alliance. Ma Sui granted the request.

The governor of Hezhong Prefecture sent his advisor, Hun Jian, to the imperial court with a message: 몮If our nation몭s armies were pressing on the Tibetan border and we were planning to invade, then perhaps it might be believable that the Tibetans would request an alliance. But, in the current situation, the Tibetans need nothing from our nation, and yet they have made this bizarre request for an alliance. Without doubt, they are plotting something.몯
But Emperor Dezong didn몭t listen.
Hun Jian and Shang Gyaltsen arranged a meeting at Pingliang, and when Hun Jian arrived, he had 3,000 men at his back. Shang Gyaltsen had positioned cavalry troops in ambush formation at a location to the west of the Alliance Hall. When the time came, tens of thousands of Tibetan cavalry troops poured forth and captured the outlying Tang troops. Hun Jian acted quickly; he leapt onto a nearby horse and fled across the Pingliang River. So, except for Hun Jian, who had been in charge of the alliance negotiations, all 60 or more Tang court officials sent to the meeting were captured by the Tibetans, including Vice Commissioner Cui Hanheng and a high-ranking court official, the eunuch Ju Wenzhen. In what went down in history as 몬The treaty ambush at Pingliang,몭 500 or more Tang soldiers were killed, and another 1,000 or more were captured.

In Chen Hao몭s commentary, he writes that when commanders from two states go on the attack, if neither side is showing any weakness, and yet one of them requests a peace treaty for no apparent reason, that means one of two things: (1) The enemy leaders are worried about some internal problem at home and, out of carelessness, have decided on a policy of peace for the time being; (2) They knew that it might be possible to try something, and they몭re trying to make you believe in yourself beyond doubt, and asking for peace now, while planning to launch a surprise attack later.

Zhang Yu comments: 몮If the enemy requests peace for no reason, there is certainly some cunning plot in play.몯 Once Liu Bang had already become Emperor Gaozu of the Han dynasty, he sent Li Yiji with a large cargo of treasures to visit with the Qin general Jia Shu and ask him to agree to peace terms. But they weren몭t even at war yet, so why would Gaozu send gifts and ask for peace? And yet, Jia Shu believed the Han Emperor. Liu Bang then took advantage of his enemy몭s lack of preparedness and alertness, and destroyed the Qin army with a single strike.

16. 몮When there is much running about and the soldiers and chariots fall into rank, it means the enemy is in a state of anticipation.몯

In Du Mu몭s commentary, he writes that this line goes together with the previous one: 몮When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.몯 Once the light chariots have staked out the flanks, then 몮there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank.몯

In an ancient text called The Rites of Zhou, it몭s written that: 몮As chariots fly forth, foot soldiers follow, halting when they reach their mark.몯 The 몬marks몭 are flags set out by the chariot personnel, signs showing the infantry units where to take up positions as they run hectically after the fast chariots.

As for the meaning of 몬anticipation,몭 it몭s possible to interpret it as being directed at the enemy몭s own foot soldiers.

Zhang Yu comments: 몮Marks are given where flags are planted, and as the general anticipates the people going forth, thus they run toward their marks.몯

17. 몮When he is halfway in advance and halfway in retreat, it is a lure.몯

This means that there몭s a lack of coordination; some soldiers move forward while others fall back, advancing and retreating at different times. The army seems like a chaotic mess, but this is engineered precisely to lure you into advancing. From the enemy몭s standpoint, he worries that if he advances, you몭ll run away, and if he retreats, you won몭t chase him. So, he does both 멪 advancing and retreating at the same time. 

18. 몮When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.몯

Send spies to watch the enemy. If you can see enemy troops far in the distance hanging onto their spears to keep themselves upright, this proves that they몭re exhausted and famished.  They몭ve run out of food.몯

19. 몮If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst.몯

If you see the men on water-fetching duty glugging it down as quickly as they can, this proves that there몭s no water left in the enemy camp, and that the whole army is suffering badly from thirst.

20. 몮If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.몯

If the enemy can see you have a weakness they could exploit, and yet they don몭t do anything about it, this shows that their troops몭 energy and battle capabilities are badly depleted.

21. 몮If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.몯

In Zhang Yu몭s commentary, he writes that in a situation where the enemy army has stealthily retreated and left their tents behind to make it seem like they몭re still there, there몭s one sign you should look out for. If birds realize that nobody몭s at home in the camp, they몭ll congregate in the sky above. So, if you see birds gathering above the enemy camp, you know that it몭s empty.
When the state of Chu invaded Zheng, the Zheng army couldn몭t hold the Chu army back, so they made ready to flee. But then a scout report came in 멪 birds had been sighted in the Chu camp. It turned out that the Chu army had reached breaking point, too, and had already turned tail and run.

When the state of Jin invaded Qi, Shu Xiang said: 몮There are birds over the city walls 멪 the Qi commanders have fled.몯 There were birds perched on the city walls, so it was a sure bet that there was nobody guarding the city; they몭d all run away. During the late years of the Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BCE), King Xian of Qi invaded Northern Qi. The Northern Qi general, Ban Shi, built fake tents using cypress branches, and then he created smoke by starting fires with ox and horse manure. The Qi army watched for two days before they realized the camp was empty. By then, it was too late to catch up with the Northern Qi forces.

22. 몮Clamor by night betokens nervousness.몯

몬Clamor몭 refers to any disturbance in the enemy camp. Any display of panic during the night means that the enemy army몭s mindset is shaky.

Cao Cao comments: 몮If the soldiers cry out at night, this means the general lacks courage.몯 

The general isn몭t brave, so he can몭t stay on top of his troops. The army has no backbone to keep it stable, making the men so jittery that every bush and tree looks like an enemy soldier.

Zhang Yu comments: 몮The general is the mainstay of any military force; if the general lacks bravery and cannot bring peace to the soldiers몭 minds, then they will become terrified and cry out during the night. For example, a Jin army once kept up their clamor throughout an entire night.몯

Chen Hao comments: 몮In ten men, if only one has courage, then though the remaining nine may be cowards, one brave man is enough to bring peace to their hearts. If tonight clamor breaks out among the soldiers, it is because the general has no courage.몯

Panic in a camp doesn몭t stop at shouting and yelling. It몭s hard to see at night, so in the madness it몭s possible that the men of the same army will start attacking and even killing one another, thinking that they몭re fighting the enemy. This is why previous sections of the book, about the rules for setting up a camp 멪 like, how closely spaced each unit should be and where fires should be lit 멪 went into such a high level of detail. If the enemy launches a surprise attack, or if panic breaks out in the camp, each subsection of the camp is to come out and form up in their sub-camp. They몭re not allowed to move, and all the fires are to be lit at once, to light the camp up as brightly as if it was daytime, making it easy to tell who몭s a friend and who몭s a foe. Also, archers and crossbowmen are to be installed at high vantage points, so they can shoot and kill any enemy soldiers who have infiltrated the camp.
While Zhou Yafu was combatting the Rebellion of the Seven States, he also had to deal with panic in his camp. The situation was so bad that his soldiers were attacking one another, and the chaos even threatened to spread to his command tent. As we몭ve discussed, his solution was to stay tucked in bed and keep sleeping. His army calmed down, naturally, on their own.

23. 몮If there is disturbance in the camp, the general몭s authority is weak.몯

The general is unable to bring stability to his army. Du Mu comments: 몮This passage says that when the general orders his army to advance and retreat without proper consideration, and generally behaves in a frivolous manner, then he has no prestige and the soldiers will cause disturbances.몯

During the Three Kingdoms period, General Zhang Liao was in command of an army stationed at Changshe. One night, a disturbance flared up among his men, and the chaos engulfed his whole army. Zhang Liao said he was certain this was the work of an enemy agent, and he ordered everybody to stay where they were and not move. Having ordered his men to sit down and stay still, he stood tall and authoritative in the middle of the army. After a while, silence and calm was restored to the camp.

24. 몮If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot.몯

Zhang Yu comments: 몮Banners and flags are the instruments by which an army is brought into order; if they waver and come untethered, this is a sign that there is confusion among the ranks.몯

As discussed earlier, banners and flags are the tools a general uses to give orders. If they are flailing around any which way, that shows that the command system has fallen apart, and confusion has infected the ranks. During the Battle of Changshao (684 BCE), between the states of Qi and Lu, there was a moment when the Qi army seemed defeated and began to flee. Duke Zhuang of Lu wanted to give chase, but Cao Gui shouted: 몮Wait a moment!몯 Cao Gui climbed onto a chariot and gazed into the distance. 몮Now! Now, give chase!몯

몮What do you see?몯 Duke Zhuang asked him.

몮I was looking to see whether their flags are in disorder. No disorder means someone is still charge and it몭s possible they몭re not really beaten, and there might be an ambush. If there몭s disorder, that means they몭re really running away and nobody몭s in command 멪 then we can go after them!몯

The Lu army pursued the fleeing Qi troops and, as expected, they won the day.

25. 몮If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.몯

Jia Lin comments: 몮When people are tired, they become angrier.몯 If officers become angry for no apparent reason, this proves that they몭re already exhausted.

Zhang Yu comments: 몮When the generals몭 commands contradict one another, people become exhausted and thus the officers grow increasingly angry.몯 Either the commander doesn몭t have a grip on the situation, and is giving commands that don몭t make sense, or he몭s inconsistent in handing out rewards and punishments. This makes people angry. Then, the officers start taking out their anger on the regular troops, and they fly into a rage for no evident reason. When this happens in an army, the men lose their fighting spirit and even start hoping that their side will lose, as revenge against their commander.

The classic historical example of this principle comes from the battle of the city of Bi, during the war between Jin and Chu, when the two states were vying for supremacy in China. At the beginning of the conflict, neither side wanted to fight; they were on the verge of starting negotiations for a peace treaty. The Jin commander-in-chief, Xun Linfu, had set his heart on building an alliance with Chu, and he wasn몭t putting much energy into preparing for war. Two generals under his command, Wei Qi and Zhao Zhan, had once asked Xun Linfu for promotion to higher ranks, but had been refused. They몭d borne a grudge ever since, and now they wanted to sabotage Xun Linfu몭s career. So, they both in turn approached Xun Linfu and asked him to let them go to the Chu camp and provoke the enemy into fighting. Xun Linfu refused their request. So, they asked instead for permission to go to the Chu camp and propose an alliance. This time, Xun Linfu gave his permission. The two scoundrels made their way to the enemy camp, and instead of trying to build an alliance, they challenged the Chu leaders to fight.

After the two men set out, another Jin general, Xi Ke, said: 몮Those two are angry about the past. If we do not make ready, certain defeat is what awaits us.몯 Nothing good would come of two disgruntled young men going to the enemy. Without proper preparations, the Jin army was bound to lose. But, Xun Linfu didn몭t take the situation seriously.

In the Chu army, there were two opposing factions: one wanted peace, the other wanted war. But when the King of Chu learned about the divisions among the Jin officers, he made up his mind 멪 there was going to be war. The Chu commanders launched a major offensive, and what happened next will come as no surprise: the Jin forces were badly beaten. When the battle was over, the state of Chu was the new superpower in China몭s Central Plain region.


Thirty-two methods for monitoring the enemy몭s condition (part three)

Extract from the original text: 
몮When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death. The sight of men whispering earnestly without ceasing, or speaking in subdued tones, points to disaffection amongst the rank and file. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy몭s numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy desires repose. If the enemy몭s troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.몯

We now come to the final seven ways outlined in The Art of War for observing the enemy, and interpreting what you see:

 26. 몮When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.몯

Grain meant for human consumption is fed to horses, the cart-oxen are cooked and eaten, the cooking pots disappear from the tree branches where they used to hang and are smashed into pieces, abandoned 멪 the enemy isn몭t planning to cook any time soon. They won몭t return to their tents; they몭re abandoning their camp. In other words, they몭re burning all their bridges, cutting off all their means of retreat and getting ready for a life-and-death struggle.

In Chapter Seven of the ancient text, Records of the Grand Historian, which is a record of Xiang Yu, there is the following passage: 몮Xiang Yu then brought all the soldiers of his army across the river; he sunk all his boats, destroyed all his cauldrons and pots, burned his shelters, and set out with rations sufficient only for three days. This was to show that each one of his men was determined to die, and not one of them intended to return.몯

What should you do in this situation? What should you do if the enemy sinks their boats and destroys their cooking pots to show they plan to fight to the death? Zhang Yu comments: 몮If the enemy behaves in this way, you should resolutely hold your position and wait for afflictions to accost him.몯 If you try to fight, you몭ll be dealing with an enemy pumped up with extremely intense energy. But, if you hold your position and don몭t come out to fight, you can make them wait until they run out of food. Let starvation do your work for you 멪 hunger can kill the enemy for you.

27. 몮The sight of men whispering earnestly, without ceasing, or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Here, 몬earnestly몭 refers to the way they speak; the constant movement of their mouths indicates the appearance of men who have lost their force of will.몯

The word used in the original text, xi, has a root meaning of 몬mouths opening and closing몭 멪 the passage conveys an image of men chattering on and on, endlessly.

These 몬whispering men몭 might be officers talking with their subordinates, or it might be rank-and-file soldiers talking amongst themselves. Either way, if your scouts spy soldiers standing around, engrossed in deep conversation, in the enemy camp, this means the enemy general has already lost the hearts and minds of his men. If the enemy general is walking around talking with various people, that shows that his army몭s mindset is unstable, and he몭s working to deal with that situation. If the enemy몭s몭 rank-and-file troops are talking amongst themselves, they몭re likely bad-mouthing their commander.

28. 몮Too-frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources멞몯

Li Quan comments: 몮The enemy is in a state of distress, so he distributes rewards in order to spur his men forward.몯

If a general is handing out rewards to his troops as if his life depended on it, it몭s because he몭s in an extremely precarious situation: his men don몭t want to work for him and they몭ve lost all respect and fear for their commander. Nothing he says can make them do what he wants, so all he can do is take out his family silver and share, it in the hope that he can buy his men몭s courage with extravagant gifts.

29. 몮Too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.몯

Just like with rewards, dishing out too many punishments will cause problems. Du Mu comments: 몮When the men are tired and the army몭s power is wilting, such that soldiers do not fear punishment, the general issues many punishments so as to instill fear in them.몯

30. 몮To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy몭s numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.몯
Jia Lin comments: 몮Orders and commands are not clearly distinguishable and the soldiers are not trained or drilled. He launches campaigns of which the premise is his own powerful desire, but when his soldiers defy him he grows fearful; this is the height of cowardice.몯

Jia Lin몭s comment cuts deep; the leadership defect he몭s describing here can be seen in a very significant number of leaders indeed! First of all, he doesn몭t stand up and take responsibility as a leader 멪 he gives confusing, contradictory orders and his troops don몭t get enough training. This creates ineptitude throughout the whole army, from rank-and-file troops to senior officers. So, what does the general do about this situation? Rather than focusing on coming up with a detailed plan, and lacking the ability to direct his troops and lead problem-solving efforts, his attitude turns inflexible and uncompromising, and he makes demands of his subordinates. He probably sounds something like this: 몮All I want from you is results! Get out there, and get it done!몯 When his subordinates fail to do what he wants, he punishes them.

Naturally, his men were not happy with their commander. They know they몭re powerless to satisfy him, but at the same time they몭re unsatisfied with his leadership. They start thinking: 몮Why don몭t you do it yourself and see how it goes? All you몭re doing is sitting there and telling us to lay down our lives for you!몯 The men can see that beneath his hard exterior; he몭s weak and cowardly inside. So, they stop doing what he tells them, and start resisting. As soon as he sees that his men aren몭t listening to him, and he can몭t keep them under control, he gets scared.

According to Jia Lin, this kind of general represents the height of cowardice.

31. 몮When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy desires repose.몯

Jia Lin comments: 몮When their energy is soft and their language apologetic, they desire to seek reconciliation between the two sides.몯

But what about this line from earlier: 몮Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance.몯 Isn몭t the basic meaning of 몬humble words몭 the same as 몬compliments in their mouths?몭 So, how can one of them mean that the enemy wants to fight, while the other one means they want peace? The key is that in the earlier line: 몬humble words몭 come together with 몬increased preparations.몭 The enemy is actually cranking up their preparations for war. How do we know the enemy isn몭t secretly making 몬increased preparations몭 when their envoys come with 몬compliments in their mouths?몭

This is why there몭s an alternative interpretation of this line: 몮When hostages are sent with compliments.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮The reason why 몬hostages are sent with compliments몭 is that the enemy is compelled to rest, either because their energy is exhausted or because of some other reason.몯

Zhang Yu comments: 몮If the enemy uses his intimate family members as hostages and sends them to you, this means their energy and strength are severely exhausted, and so they desire a repose from war, and to let their soldiers rest.몯 When the enemy is even sending their loved ones off as hostages, this means they have no other choice 멪 they몭re utterly spent.

32. 몮If the enemy몭s troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Prepare to face an ambush.몯

Zhang Yu comments: 몮When the enemy comes with fury and bluster, and yet neither initiate battle nor withdraw, then you should keep close formation and wait; inevitably, he will have prepared an ambush.몯


 Don몭t rely on the younger generation to fight your wars for you, and don몭t pin your hopes to your allies

Many people keep busy every day going to all kinds of events in the hope of 몬meeting people.몭 But, if you몭re a somewhat capable person and you have your own business to take care of, you don몭t have the time or the motivation to run around trying to 몬meet people.몭 You몭re better off staying at home and looking after your children. Not investing enough of your own time in your children is a common problem, one that afflicts all too many professionals, and it몭s a serious blunder in terms of a person몭s investment strategy.

Extract from the original text:
몮Greater numbers of soldiers do not equate to advantage; do not advance relying solely upon military might. Proper personnel selections are sufficient to concentrate all our available strength and anticipate the enemy몭s movements. He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.몯

Analysis:
몮If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made. What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, anticipate the enemy몭s movements, and obtain reinforcements.몯
What makes an army strong isn몭t filling it with as many troops as possible, but the ability to refrain from charging forward blindly, to bring its power to bear in specific places, and to accurately assess the enemy몭s situation. This is all that몭s needed to make a strong army. And the key to being able to 몬concentrate all our available strength, and anticipate the enemy몭s movements몭 is to pick the right people to work for you.

몮Greater numbers of soldiers do not equate to advantage.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Attain balance between the power of your army and the extent of your authority.몯
Wang Xi comments: 몮It will suffice to attain an even balance between the power of your army and the extent of your authority. Do not believe that it is always good to have more.몯
What do they mean by 몬an even balance between the power of your army and the extent of your authority?몭 It몭s about being able to dominate your army. If your army reaches a size beyond your ability to control and dominate it, adding more troops isn몭t going to do you any good.
Han Xin once claimed that, as far his own leadership ability was concerned, there was no such thing as too many troops. Whether 100,000 or a million, he could dominate any army. He also claimed that Liu Bang didn몭t have the skill to lead more than 100,000 men at a time; that was supposedly the upper limit of his leadership abilities. But, Han Xin did say that although Liu Bang wasn몭t a good leader of soldiers, he was a very good leader of generals 멪 that was why he was able to handle Han Xin.

몮Do not advance relying solely upon military might.몯

Wang Xi comments: 몮One cannot rely solely on martial might; one should proceed using wisdom and planning to predict the enemy몭s movements.몯

몮Proper personnel selections are sufficient to concentrate all our available strength and anticipate the enemy몭s movements.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Personally cultivating them will suffice.몯
Being able to 몬concentrate all our available strength and anticipate the enemy몭s movements몭 is all about choosing the right people to work for you. And where should you look for these talented individuals? Cao Cao has the answer: 몬personally cultivate몭 them. Don몭t bother with outside hiring 멪 the people you need are already in your army. They몭re the next generation; you trained them yourself. So, how are you supposed to 몬cultivate몭 your soldiers? In the next part, we몭ll dive into how it몭s done.
This is a major strategic and organizational concept. It몭s about relying on the internal strength of your organization, and picking talented people from inside, instead of relying on outside help. With armies, the important thing isn몭t to have as many troops as possible. On top of that, your leadership ability needs to match the number of men under your command. You need to be able to unify your army 멪 to hold the reins and stay in charge. That몭s why you shouldn몭t rely on people from outside.
This is a relevant passage from the Wei Liaozi: 몮Any time that reinforcements are called upon in war, if it is claimed that 100,000 men will come, then in reality only a fraction of that number will materialize. Moreover, among those that come, every one of them remonstrates with their general: 몬Let us not fight first on their behalf.몭몯
This is exactly what happened when the six remaining states at the end of the Warring States period were finally wiped from the map by the state of Qin. The Qin armies fought for their own kingdom, so when they won, the victory belonged to Qin. The same was true when they lost. But, the other six states joined their armies together, meaning that nobody wanted to be the first to fight. That몭s because if they lost, they몭d have to own it, and even if they won they might still come out the other end as a loser.
It몭s the same with development strategy for businesses. To develop, you need to rely on your own strength. If you want to get into a coalition with other businesses, so you can 몬complement each other몭s competitive advantages,몭 it몭s because you몭re hoping the other companies will help you out with developing your business. You몭d be better off letting go of such hopes!
The same principle applies on the level of individual people. People often say that 몬Each friend you make opens up a new opportunity.몭 But, while it몭s true that friends can help you, you can몭t expect your friends to make things happen for you. As we몭ve said, many people keep busy every day going to all kinds of events in the hope of 몬meeting people.몭 Don몭t waste your time; you won몭t derive real benefit from all the running around.

몮He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.몯

A passage in the Zuo Commentary reads: 몮Lords must not refer to Zhu as a small state. Even bees and chai have venom within; how much more venom is there within a state?몯
Chai are a kind of venomous insect, similar to scorpions.
Armies aren몭t just about large numbers, and disaster doesn몭t just happen when lots of things go wrong 멪 a single, small problem could be your undoing. If you have courage but not wisdom, and if you underestimate your enemy, you몭ll definitely end up getting captured.
There was war between the states of Song and Chu in the Spring and Autumn period, during which the Song commander-in-chief, Hua Yuan, once cooked a big pot of mutton soup. He shared the soup with his men, and they happily ate it. Unfortunately, he forgot about his chariot driver. That whole night, the driver drooled, and all the while his resentment grew. The next day on the battlefield, before any orders had been given, the chariot driver suddenly spurred the horses forward and, without saying a word, charged straight into the Chu lines. His startled passenger 멪 the commander Hua Yuan 멪 was captured.
And that몭s how even a little bee sting can be fatal.

몮If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive.몯

This line is where we move on to talk about how to cultivate your personnel.


The deepest essence of human relationships 멨 People taming people

Extract from the original text:
몮If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless. Therefore, soldiers must be treated in the first instance with civil values, but kept under control by military values. This is a certain road to victory. If, in training soldiers, commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well disciplined; if not, its discipline will be poor. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.몯

Analysis:
Cao Cao comments: 몮Personally cultivating them will suffice.몯 Use soldiers who you몭ve raised yourself. This one word, 몬cultivating,몭 is pregnant with meaning.
In the original text, the word translated here as 몬cultivating몭 contains two characters. The first one, si, has a basic meaning of 몬sticking close together.몭
The words used to express the idea of 몬cultivating personnel몭 in the original text could be interpreted as insulting, as if describing a dog someone was taming. But if the people being cultivated are like dogs, at least you know they몭ll be unfailingly loyal to their master.
If you turn things around and look at this potentially insulting language (몬taming몭) from the master몭s perspective, then if you train your soldiers to be like your dogs (몬unfailingly loyal몭), isn몭t that a good thing, in terms of military command and control in times of war?
So, it would seem that 몬taming몭 people like this works out pretty well.
But, do we understand how to tame people? Have we ourselves at some point been tamed by someone?
Turning the question around again, would we want to be tamed by someone else? Would we know how to be tamed?
There몭s an expression in Chinese: 몬A person who you look after, but who never really becomes part of the family.몭 No matter how well you treat this person, they don몭t understand you and never take after your way of thinking. So, you end up leaving this person.
If we turn this back on ourselves, could it be possible that there are people who would use this expression to describe us? I몭m afraid that the answer is yes. There have been those who think this way about us, who몭ve treated us so well that we took it for granted and thought it was normal. We lower the standards we hold ourselves to and end up hurting the very person who was looking after us.
This line of thought is profound. Under its surface, there lies a vast body of learning.
몬Keeping and training몭 is the subject matter of a certain, highly influential work of world literature, one that몭s been called 몬a fairytale for adults몭 멪 The Little Prince.
The Little Prince, a short story by the poet and journalist Antoine de Saint-Exup?ry, is a famous work of French children몭s literature published in in 1943. The main character is a little prince who comes from another planet, and the story몭s narrator is a pilot. He tells of how the prince set out on a journey from his planet towards earth, and about all the adventures he experienced on the way.
In one part of the story, the little prince meets a fox who demands that the prince take him in and look after him. The fox explains the essential qualities of the relationship between the person in charge and the creature who몭s being looked after: love and responsibility. The way a leader should keep, look after and train the people in their charge is all about love and responsibility.
Let몭s read a bit of the story. It몭s a long passage, but it몭s one that몭s absolutely worth reading, re-reading, and thinking about in detail

"Come and play with me," proposed the little prince. "I am so unhappy." "I cannot play with you," the fox said. "I am not tamed." "Ah! Please excuse me," said the little prince. But, after some thought, he added: "What does that mean 멪 'tame?몭" "You do not live here," said the fox. "What is it that you are looking for?" "I am looking for men," said the little prince. "What does that mean 멪 'tame?몭" "Men," said the fox. "They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?" "No," said the little prince. "I am looking for friends. What does that mean 멪 'tame?몭" "It is an act too often neglected," said the fox. 몮It means to establish ties." "'To establish ties'?" "Just that," said the fox. "To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world..." "I am beginning to understand," said the little prince. "There is a flower... I think that she has tamed me..." "It is possible," said the fox. "On the Earth one sees all sorts of things." "Oh, but this is not on the Earth!" said the little prince. The fox seemed perplexed, and very curious. "On another planet?" "Yes." "Are there hunters on this planet?" "No." "Ah, that is interesting! Are there chickens?" "No." "Nothing is perfect," sighed the fox. But he came back to his idea. "My life is very monotonous," the fox said. "I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain?fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat..." The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time. "Please 멪 tame me!" he said. "I want to, very much," the little prince replied. "But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand." "One only understands the things that one tames," said the fox. "Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends anymore. If you want a friend, tame me..." "What must I do, to tame you?" asked the little prince. "You must be very patient," replied the fox. "First you will sit down at a little distance from me 멪 like that 멪 in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day..." The next day the little prince came back. "It would have been better to come back at the same hour," said the fox. "If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites..." "What is a rite?" asked the little prince. "Those also are actions too often neglected," said the fox. "They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all." So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near 멪 "Ah," said the fox, "I shall cry." "It is your own fault," said the little prince. "I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you..." "Yes, that is so," said the fox. "But now you are going to cry!" said the little prince. "Yes, that is so," said the fox. "Then it has done you no good at all!" "It has done me good," said the fox, "because of the color of the wheat fields." And then he added: "Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret." The little prince went away, to look again at the roses. "You are not at all like my rose," he said. "As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world." And the roses were very much embarrassed. "You are beautiful, but you are empty," he went on. "One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you 멪 the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.

The reason why The Little Prince has been described as a fairytale for adults is because it lays bare the deepest essence of how humans relate to one another. That essence is, in a phrase, 몬taming몭 one another.
Bosses and their underlings tame one another; husbands and wives tame one another; businesses and consumers tame one another; governments and ordinary people tame one another. To tame someone is to establish a bond with them. Once there몭s a bond between us, I know how you몭ll treat me, and how you몭ll behave at different times and in different circumstances. Also, I know how I should treat you.
Taming someone is about love and responsibility, expectations and dependence.
The relationships built by the act of taming are deep, and yet they also become increasingly fragile as they gain more depth 멪 they cannot survive even the slightest betrayal.
In taming, there are no surprises; everything runs its course, steadily and dependably. For example, look at how circus troupes tame their animals. When they train a dolphin to bounce a ball on its head, it is absolutely certain that each time it bounces the ball, it will be fed a fish. There몭s no way the one-fish-for-one-bounce mechanism can fail. If it does, even once, it will not be possible for the show to go on.
Now, let몭s get back to The Art of War. 
몮Bear in your mind the interests of those under your command and be able to make them aware of it.몯
This is one of the regulations at The United States Military Academy.
In relationships based on taming, it몭s important to be mindful of the other person; you can몭t just think about your own goals. It몭s also essential that the other person knows you몭re being mindful of them, and that they trust you to think on their behalf. If you feel that the other person in this relationship is keeping distant from you, then, unfortunately, that몭s probably because you haven몭t factored them into your thinking enough. Or, perhaps, you haven몭t been able to make them aware that you몭re thinking about them.
Teams must understand the need for members to tame each other, and each of them must also enter into the spirit and ritual of taming one another.
You could spend a lifetime practicing this skill, and still have more to learn. 
That said, let몭s read another piece from Sun Tzu:

몮If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless.몯

If you try to use punishment as a method for managing your soldiers before they몭ve become personally attached to you, they won몭t accept that you몭re right. If they don몭t accept that you몭re right, it will be very difficult to put them to use.
Du Mu comments: 몮Without trust and kindness having first been established, it will not do to use punishment to bring your soldiers into line.몯
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Use morality to make yourself supreme over them; use kindness to bring them close to you. Without applying morality and kindness, they will not accept your punishments but rather will grow resentful. It will be difficult to use them.몯
First, you have to make your people respect and love you. Only then can they respect and fear you at the same time. If you want everyone to be scared of you from the very start, you won몭t make it as a leader.

몮If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.몯

This situation is the opposite 멪 if everyone몭s already attached to you, but you몭re unable to enforce strict discipline, your army won몭t be any use in a battle.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Kindness and trust having been established, if you do not employ punishments, then the soldiers become arrogant, slothful, and useless.몯
If you have kindness but no authority, love but no punishments, your troops and officers will grow lazy and arrogant. They몭ll be of no use to you.
All of this is the territory of what could be called 몬The Way of Taming.몭


몮Therefore, soldiers must be treated in the first instance with civil values, but kept under control by military values. This is a certain road to victory.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮몬Civil values몭 means 몬benevolence.몭 몬Military values몭 means 몬law.몭몯
몬Civil values몭 are about soothing and pacifying people 멪 they몭re the carrot to the stick of 몬military values,몭 which consist of martial discipline and law. You need both the carrot and the stick if you want to create an army that몭s guaranteed to win.
몮A man capable of using civil values to build intimacy with the people, and military values to extend authority over his enemies.몯 This is a recommendation for Sima Rangju, written by the ancient statesman Yan Ying.
Wu Qi wrote: 몮He who combines civil and military values may take command of an army; he who can be both hard and soft has the ability to fight wars.몯

몮If, in training soldiers, commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be poor. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.몯

Note the use of the word 몬habitually몭멪 it몭s important. You don몭t wait until you몭re on the battlefield to start enforcing commands. Just imagine: 몬Alright! The battle몭s about to start, so it몭s time to start enforcing some commands! We normally like to keep it nice and casual, but this time is different!몭 It몭s precisely during the 몬normal몭 times that you need to strictly enforce your commands. This way, your troops will get in the habit of obeying them.
If your normal way of doing things is very relaxed, and you don몭t instill good habits in your men, they won몭t obey you on the battlefield when you finally do start to insist on strict compliance with your commands. They simply won몭t be in the habit of doing so.
The only way to build well-oiled coordination between the ranks of an army is to train your troops to jump when you tell them to.
Du Mu comments: 몮When staying in a fixed position, on days when there is no other business to attend to, one must, as a priority, instill in one몭s men trust and fear towards you, an awareness of your kindness, and compliance with commands. Then, when the time comes to face the enemy and you issue commands and call upon the laws, every one of your men will obey멞 Commands must be clearly stated in advance, so that people are not confused when they hear them; laws must be enforced, so that people abide by them and do not look upon them lightly. The 몬three commands and five orders몭 must be demonstrated to people so as to avert confusion. Laws and commands should be simple and adequate, and any law that is introduced must be enforced. Then, it will be possible for the general and his men to understand one another.몯
There are two crucial elements when it comes to commands and rules: make clear what they are as early as possible, so that everyone knows exactly what they mean; and any law that you establish absolutely must be enforced, with no exceptions.
몬The three commands and five orders몭 refers to the ancient Chinese system of military laws and rules. 
The first 몬command몭 is: 몬Keep watch over the enemy몭s plots, observe the state of the roads and other transport routes as regards ease of use, and be informed about where the places of life and the places of death are located.몭
The second 몬command몭 is: 몬Keep your ears alert to the sound of gongs and drums and your eyes alert to flags and banners, so that your eyes and ears work in unison.몭
The third 몬command몭 is: 몬Raise the axe high, to make known what are the punishments and what are the rewards.몭
Now, for the 몬five orders.몭
The first 몬order몭 is: 몬Use rewards and punishments to make their hearts and minds as one.몭
The second 몬order몭 is: 몬Observe the way they divide and come together, so as to make their movements as one.몭
The third 몬order몭 is: 몬Draw battle lines using flags and banners.몭
The fourth 몬order몭 is: 몬When fighting at night, listen for fire and drums.몭
Finally, the fifth 몬order몭 is: 몬To any who does not reverently obey orders, look upon him with the axe.몭
To make everyone in your organization feel secure and rooted, you need to make the 몬three commands and five orders몭 totally clear. Make your rules and orders simple and appropriate, enforce all of your rules, and don몭t make any exceptions. If you do this, your people몭s minds will be clear and unclouded.
However, if the 몬three commands and five orders몭 become nothing more than empty words 멪 if you enforce the rules selectively, even though all of your men are guilty of violations 멪 they몭ll get in the habit of trusting to their luck. At the same time, this situation makes men feel anxious and insecure.
There몭s a passage from the Wei Liaozi that reads: 몮If, in the rules which you employ to give orders, there are found some small errors, do not change the rules; if you find some minor issues involving lack of clarity, do not reformulate them. The reason for acting this way is that the senior officers will not doubt the commands they give, and the soldiers will not conjure up two interpretations of each command. If you can act without hesitation or doubt, then the soldiers will not have second thoughts about their will to act. Thus, you will not face a situation where you cannot command confidence and trust in their minds, but will be able to harness their strength; having averted the possibility of not being able to harness their strength, you will be able to make them fight unto death.몯
This is about how to make rules. If you realize, after the fact, that there are some minor issues with your rules, as long as they몭re not serious, don몭t change them. Just keep on enforcing them the way they are. If there are some minor parts of your rules that aren몭t easy to understand, don몭t try to re-write them. Rules are rules 멪 once you몭ve made them, just keep enforcing them.
It몭s important that rules be strict, authoritative and stable, more so than how practical they are. For example, when Zhuge Liang was enmeshed in fighting the Wei army, he started off outnumbered. Despite this, when the prescribed time came for a portion of his soldiers몭 military service to end, he was bound by his own rules to send them home. 몮Trust cannot be lost,몯 he said. He didn몭t keep them until the fighting was over and then send them home; he let them go on exactly the predetermined date. This in fact inspired them to stay with Zhuge Liang, and fight at least one more battle. This trust between the general and his soldiers was like rocket fuel for his army몭s morale. Zhuge Liang ended that campaign by inflicting a massive defeat on the Wei army.
This is how Zhuge Liang and his men 몬tamed몭 one another.


Appendix: Complete text of The Army on the March

Sun Tzu said: 몮We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys. Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare. After crossing a river, you should get far away from it. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river he has to cross. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare. In crossing salt marshes and swamps, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay. If forced to fight in a salt marsh or a swamp, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. So much for operations in salt marshes. In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country. These are the four useful branches of military knowledge that enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four sovereigns. All armies prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark. If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground. When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river that you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides. Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not approached. While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear. If an army on the march should encounter any steep and obstructed terrain, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking. When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position. When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance. If his place of encampment is easy of access, he holds an advantage. Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing. The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious. The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade. Startled beasts indicate that the enemy is surging forth. When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry. When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping. Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving forward as if to attack are signs that he will retreat. When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle. Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot. When there is much running about and the soldiers and chariots fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst. 
몮If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are in chaos. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. Clamor by night betokens nervousness. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general몭s authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking pots over the camp fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death. The sight of men whispering earnestly without ceasing or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy몭s numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy desires repose. If the enemy몭s troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection. Greater numbers of soldiers do not equate to advantage; do not advance relying solely upon military might. Proper personnel selections are sufficient to concentrate all our available strength and anticipate the enemy몭s movements. He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless. Therefore, soldiers must be treated in the first instance with civil values, but kept under control by military values. This is a certain road to victory. If, in training soldiers, commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well disciplined; if not, its discipline will be poor. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.몯


Chapter Ten: Terrain

Six terrain types and how to fight in them (part one): First, occupy the most favourable terrain

Extract from the original text:
몮We may distinguish six kinds of terrain: (1) Accessible ground; (2) Entangling ground; (3) Temporizing ground; (4) Narrow passes; (5) Precipitous heights; (6) Positions at a great distance from the enemy. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible. With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, benefiting your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to reoccupy is called entangling. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.몯

Analysis:
Here is Cao Cao몭s commentary to begin the chapter on Terrain: 몮If you wish to fight, assess the terrain. Use it as the foundation upon which to construct your victory.몯
Terrain is crucial to fighting battles. That몭s why you must assess and familiarize yourself with the terrain before the fighting begins. This is the only way to 몬construct victory.몭
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Whenever an army goes on the march, first send out an advance party to search for enemy ambushes; order them to sweep all the land, mountains and rivers within a distance of fifty li. Then, the general shall personally inspect the terrain, and by his inspections, shall map the land so that he may know where it presents danger and where it may be easily traversed. In this way, when an army marches into foreign territory, victory is constructed upon an assessment of the terrain. When this has been done, then soldiers may be dispatched.몯
Having this information allows you to choose a good location to engage in the fight.
Every time Li Shimin went to war, he unfailingly inspected the terrain in person. He even scouted out enemy camps, putting himself in danger many times in the process. He never palmed off this work to other people 멪 it had to be him. The reason behind this principle is that, whatever question you might have, the answer will be found at the spot where the battle will take place. These places are almost 몬alive.몭 They talk to you. Once you arrive, you몭ll know where and how to send your troops into action; you몭ll be able to sketch out a mental outline for every step you take, so by the time the battle begins you몭ll already have a few cards up your sleeve.
During the Three Kingdoms period, there was a high-ranking Wei general named Deng Ai, who was sent with an army to attack and attempt to destroy the kingdom of Shu Han. Deng Ai came from a poor family and had once worked as a junior official in charge of a few rice fields under Cao Cao몭s Tuntian system of state-organized farming. He was a very intelligent, educated man, and he deeply enjoyed military life. Whenever he was on the move, every time his journey took him to a high mountain or a big river, he would scout the surrounding area and hold elaborate discussions about where would be a good spot to camp, where to set up an ambush, and what route the enemy would take if they were to attack. The people around him made fun of him for this diligent intelligence gathering, analysis and planning, but he didn몭t care in the slightest.
Just like landscape painters who liked to search out strangely shaped mountains and sketch every one they could find, Deng Ai was constantly formulating projections based on everything he saw, constantly practicing and mentally rehearsing battles in whatever type of terrain he came across. Twenty years passed without anything of much significance happening, until finally he was promoted and given a position as a 몬Commandant of Agriculture.몭 He몭d been put in charge of managing a few farms, which gave him the opportunity to travel to the capital city, Luoyang, where he was to deliver a report. He was able to meet with General Sima Yi, and the conversation that ensued changed his life. He was brought into the palace, and he finally had his chance to do something great for his country.
At this point, let몭s talk about 몬the six types of terrain.몭

몮(1) Accessible ground; (2) Entangling ground; (3) Temporizing ground; (4) Narrow passes; (5) Precipitous heights; (6) Positions at a great distance from the enemy.몯

1) Accessible ground:

몮Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.몯

Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Places where transport routes intersect and expedite travel.몯

Du You comments: 몮All such places are in level expanses, expeditious for coming and going.몯 These places are accessible to your forces and the enemy몭s alike; neither side can obstruct the other.


몮With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, benefiting your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage.몯


What몭s the right way to fight on terrain where neither side is able to block their opponent몭s access? The first thing to do is to occupy the high ground, from where you몭ll have a clear view of the surrounding area. Make sure your position faces the sun and that your grain re-supply carts can get in and out easily. This is how to create a more beneficial situation.
Cao Cao comments: 몮It is better to maneuver the enemy to come to you than to be maneuvered by the enemy.몯

Du Mu writes that 몬accessible land몭 consists of places where a battle could happen anywhere 멪 the enemy could come from any direction. He also emphasizes that you should occupy the high ground, facing into the sun, and not allow the enemy to get there first. That몭s because it몭s not easy when you몭re in a flat landscape to find a piece of elevated ground big enough for a large army to camp.

How are you supposed to 몬benefit your line of supplies?몭 Build defensive structures or walls either side of the road in key 몬crossroad몭 locations. This is how to protect your supply lines, and building walled-in roads between key grain depots is exactly what Liu Bang did during his war against Xiang Yu. He relied on these structures to secure his food supply.

Zhang Yu writes that you should position yourself at the battlefield and wait for the enemy to come to you 멪 this is how to maneuver the enemy while avoiding being maneuvered. But what if you do this, and even though you hold the best terrain, the enemy never comes? Meanwhile, you몭re burning through food supplies every day. That몭s why it몭s essential to secure your food supply and make sure your supply lines don몭t get cut.

Reading Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, we realize that much of the time, the best strategy is to wait for the enemy to come to you. It몭s essential to know how to wait, and to be able to put that ability into practice. Some people can몭t wait; to them, waiting is the same as doing nothing. That몭s why such people are likely to act without thinking and are bound to make mistakes.

Before we move on, I몭ll add a few words about how Liu Bang몭s war against Xiang Yu wrapped up.

Liu Bang held the granaries, so he and his men had plenty to eat every day. Meanwhile, Xiang Yu몭s supply lines were cut by the Han armies, and his troops suffered unspeakable hunger. Ultimately, this led Xiang Yu to accept peace terms, which fixed the borders between the kingdoms of Chu and Han. But, the moment that Xiang Yu had signed the peace treaty and pulled his troops back, Liu Bang immediately tore up the treaty and attacked while the enemy몭s spirit was 몬sluggish and inclined to return.몭 Soon after, he fought the final battle of the war at Gaixia, where Xiang Yu slit his own throat on the bank of the River Wu.


Six terrain types and how to fight in them (part two): True heroes understand the waiting game

Extract from the original text:
몮Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to reoccupy is called entangling. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue. When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.몯

Analysis:
2) Entangling ground:
몮Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to reoccupy is called entangling.몯
When you몭re able to travel to a place, but unable to get out again, you몭ve become entangled. Du Mu comments: 몮That which is called 몬entangling몭 is when one is drawn in and hung up.몯

몮From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.몯

When you come across 몬entangling ground,몭 you need to observe whether the enemy is prepared to hold off an attack. If they몭re unprepared, you can send out your troops and beat him using a surprise attack. But, if they몭re prepared, you won몭t be able to get the upper hand in an attack, and you몭ll find yourself unable to move forward or backward without serious difficulty.
Du Mu comments: 몮Entangling ground is a place of danger and obstruction, both for oneself and for one몭s enemy. Presented with a jagged, uneven line between the two sides, any move might cause one to become entangled and obstructed. Moving to attack the enemy, if the enemy be unprepared, then one몭s attack is certain to bring victory. Thus, although one is situated amidst danger and obstructions, the enemy is already defeated and will be unable to intercept my route of retreat. If, having moved to attack the enemy, the enemy is prepared, then victory will be impossible. Then, with the enemy holding a defensive position in a dangerous and obstructed location, they will block one몭s road of retreat, rendering it difficult to return.몯
If the enemy is unprepared and you launch a surprise attack, the enemy is already beaten. At that point, you don몭t care about the terrain. But, if the enemy is prepared, you won몭t be able to dislodge them, and they몭ll cut off your escape route. Unfortunately for you, you몭re likely to get hung up to dry.
What are you supposed to do if you find yourself in this unpleasant situation? 몮If, despite one몭s efforts, one is trapped there, one must adopt a stratagem of holding one몭s own for a long duration; plunder grain from the enemy so that you may wait for an advantageous situation, upon which you must seize and strike the enemy.몯 This advice comes from Chen Hao몭s commentary.
Dear old Mister Chen is just trying to make you feel better. In reality, he몭s putting you in even more danger! If you몭re all tangled up in treacherous terrain, with an enemy in front of you that you can몭t beat, and your way back cut off, what makes you think you몭ll be able to steal the enemy몭s food and hold out over the long haul? In this situation, you only have three choices: (1)  Wait for reinforcements to come and save the day, in which case everything몭s coming up roses; (2) Stand and fight 멪 go all out and hope you can beat the practically insurmountable odds. However, the result is likely to be the death of your entire army. Otherwise, you몭re not really in 몬entangling ground; (3) Admit defeat and surrender.
The Art of War doesn몭t teach anything about surrendering, which is a serious problem. If you don몭t admit defeat when it몭s the right thing to do, all that몭s left for you is to give up your life.
Why do I say that Chen Hao is putting people in danger? Here, Sun Tzu hasn몭t taught us what to do in this dire situation, because he doesn몭t have a solution. And yet, here we have a 몬solution,몭 because Chen Hao has made one up.
You mustn몭t go into 몬entangling ground몭 멪 if you do, there몭s no coming back 99% of the time. The moment your escape route is cut off, you몭re totally trapped. But, Chen Hao tells us that 몬where there몭s a will, there몭 a way.몭 He tells us he has a solution, and when we hear this our ears perk up. Hope stirs in us that, with a bit of luck, we might just pull it off. This na?ve hope, combined with a compulsion to do something, is what got you in this mess in the first place. Admittedly, it몭s true that this has sometimes worked. You can find the proof if you flick through the history books, and knowing this, your confidence swells some more. But the reality is that this kind of situation has played out 1,000 times through history, and 999 times, it몭s ended in death. There몭s no point writing something down that몭s happened so many times, but the one time when it worked and the protagonists came out alive 멪 that몭s enough to convince you it몭ll work out the same way for you, or even better.
And so, you venture into the 몬entangling ground몭 anyway, and what happens? You get hung up to dry.

       3) Temporizing ground[bd32]:
      몮When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground.몯
If you and the enemy are on either side of a narrow strip of crossable land, meaning that whoever moves first will be at a disadvantage, this is called 몬temporizing ground.몭
For example, suppose there몭s a narrow canyon separating two armies. Whoever attacks first will have to pass through the canyon, and while they몭re inside, they몭ll be vulnerable to ambush. Or, suppose there몭s a river separating the two armies. If one side wants to attack, they몭ll have to cross the river, which gives their opponents the chance to attack before they몭ve finished crossing. The upshot is that neither side is keen to make the first move.
In this situation, even though the enemy may offer us attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn. Then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.
Chen Hao writes in his commentary that if both sides send out troops in difficult terrain, it몭s vital that you not chase after the enemy if they try to bait you. You should pull your army back, and if the enemy doesn몭t chase after you, forget about it. If they do chase after you, wait until they몭re halfway through the 몬temporizing ground,몭 and then strike as quickly as possible.
In an earlier case study, we learned about a standoff between Commander Yang Chufu of the state of Jin and Commander Zi Shang of the state of Chu. The two armies stood on either side of the River Zhi, and Commander Yang Chufu decided he wanted to make the enemy come across the river so he could attack before they몭d finished crossing. He pulled his men back from the riverbank and set up camp. Meanwhile, Commander Zi Shang had the same idea, and he also pulled his men back and set up camp some distance away from the river. Both men were thinking alike, and, each unable to fool the other, they both retreated further and further away from the river, until it became obvious that nothing was going to happen. At that point, they both quit while they were ahead and marched back home.
This is an example of 몬temporizing ground.몭 All that means is that whoever moves first will be at a disadvantage. So, both sides try to lure the enemy into attacking first. When they fail to bait each other, they give up the idea of fighting and just go home.
Some might ask, 몬What has this got to do with the art of war, if there몭s no fighting and nobody wins?몭
As we몭ve said again and again, the most important part of the art of war isn몭t fighting, but not fighting. Why do we lose? Why do our troops die and why do our commanders몭 heads get separated from their bodies? It몭s because we decided to fight.
If we don몭t fight, we can몭t lose.
If we don몭t fight, there몭ll always be a chance to fight in the future. If we fight, lose and end up dead, we몭ll never have another chance.
This is why Sun Tzu talks about winning first and fighting later. If you haven몭t already won, don몭t fight. Obviously, this means there aren몭t many situations where you actually fight; most of the time, you should choose to not fight. If you do fight, finish the job with one battle. If you look closely at the major historical case studies 멪 such as when Zhou Yafu put down the Rebellion of the Seven States 멪 they can all be summed up as 몬waiting instead of fighting, then settling the score in a single battle.몭
A true hero is someone who몭s mastered the waiting game, and who understands how to hold off from fighting. Heroes who spend their whole time fighting belong in the movies; their only job is to put on a show. True heroes understand one, simple truth: if you don몭t go looking for death, you won몭t get yourself killed.


Six terrain types and how to fight in them (part three): Ability to judge when you몭re doomed to lose is more important than confidence that victory is yours

Extract from the original text:
몮With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, fill them up and await the advent of the enemy. Should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned. With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage. These six are the principles connected with Earth. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.몯

Analysis:
3) Narrow passes:

몮With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, fill them up and await the advent of the enemy.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Narrow passes are canyons giving passage between two mountains. Here, the enemy몭s force is powerless to harm me.몯

High mountains on either side, and a canyon in between 멪 if I seize this position, there몭s only one road the enemy can take to get to me. If I hold the entrance to the canyon, he몭s powerless to attack me.

If you come across this kind of terrain, 몬fill it up and await the advent of the enemy.몭 The notion of 몬filling it up몭 is the same idea as filling a sink with water: deploy your men in a formation that uses up all the space in the pass. How do you do this? Deploy troops on either side of the pass. Cao Cao writes: 몮Square your forces with the entrance of the defile,몯 meaning that your battle lines should precisely cover the entrance to the pass. Each pass has two entrances 멪 one in the front, and one in the back 멪 so you need to deploy troops on both sides. This is how to make sure nobody can get in.


몮Should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.몯


If the enemy seizes the pass before you and fills it up with his men, stay away. If he only deploys troops on one side of the pass, or if he doesn몭t secure it at all, you should attack, because without securing both sides of the pass, the terrain isn몭t giving him any advantage. Who will win then comes down to the people in both armies, rather than the terrain.

We몭ve already learned about how General Han Xin defeated the state of Zhao. In that war, the Zhao army failed to secure Jingxing Pass, allowing Han Xin to saunter unopposed through the dangerous terrain.

4) Precipitous heights:

몮With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.몯

Places described as 몬precipitous heights몭 are strategic locations, easy to defend and difficult to attack. If you get there first, you can set up in high, sunny ground, and wait for the enemy to come to you. This is about the importance of seizing the high ground before your enemy can.


몮If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.몯


Du Mu comments: 몮Precipitous heights are places of steep mountains and deep ravines, against which human strength is impotent. It is essential to occupy the high, sunny ground, and there await the enemy. If the enemy seizes the position first, then you must not contend with him, but should entice him to leave his position. Sunny ground is that which faces south. It is likely that the enemy will hold his position for a long time; if you position yourself on shady ground, then disease will spread through your ranks. Should you encounter the enemy in mountainous or watery terrain, then first move to occupy a position in the mountains to the north; thus, you will be facing into the sun and away from the shade. Facing the sun, or holding a high position 멪 between these two, one may sacrifice a sunny position for the sake of gaining a high position, but not the other way round. Sun Tzu wrote about this in general terms.몯

If the enemy occupies a strategic location, you can몭t beat him through force of arms alone. If it몭s obvious that you can몭t win, don몭t fight. Pull your troops back and retreat. If the enemy chases after you, he몭s left his strategic location and lost his terrain advantage and you can set an ambush. If he doesn몭t chase after you, let him stay on his mountain. Time to go home.

Cao Cao comments: 몮In dangerous and constricted terrain, it is particularly important not to be maneuvered by the enemy.몯 It몭s essential not to attack in this kind of terrain. 

Duke Li of Wei wrote that the entirety of The Art of War boils down to just one sentence: 몮Manipulate your foe, and do not allow yourself to be manipulated.몯 In practice, this means that you have to set up the battlefield and wait for the enemy to bring the fight to you. Accordingly, it also means refusing to go to a battlefield if it was chosen by the enemy.

5) Great distances:

몮If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage.몯

In terrain characterized by 몬great distances,몭 your army and the enemy army are positioned far apart. If you몭re in this situation, and if your capabilities are evenly matched with the enemy, you shouldn몭t try to start a fight. In Du Mu몭s commentary, he gives an example: If your army is 30 li distant from your enemy, and you march out to attack the enemy camp, your men will be exhausted by the time you get there, while the enemy is still fresh. But if you wait for them to come to you looking for a fight, you can stay fresh and just wait while they tire themselves out.

What if you absolutely have to fight? 몮Those who are determined in their desire to fight should move closer to the enemy,몯 Du Mu writes. Move your camp closer to the enemy.
This solution comes straight from Du Mu몭s imagination, not from anything Sun Tzu wrote. Sun Tzu only wrote about the characteristics of 몬great distances몭 in terms of general principles. The only place to get a detailed, specific solution is the battlefield. No two places are the same, and no two battles are the same.


몮These six are the principles connected with Earth. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.몯


These six terrain types, and the 몬art of terrain,몭 are crucial considerations. For any general or leader, it몭s simply not an option to be ignorant about such an important subject. It몭s a big responsibility.

When we몭re at war, we몭re all more than willing to drum up confidence within ourselves that victory is the only outcome. But, for generals, it몭s more important to be a good judge of when you몭re 몬doomed to fail몭 than to be confident of victory. If you know that you몭ve lost the initiative and the terrain advantage, don몭t engage. The biggest disaster is when you don몭t know that you몭re going to lose and walk blindly into a fight.

Zhuge Liang had a Chinese Dream 멪 to unify all of China. This is why, even though it was obvious that his kingdom was no match for the state of Wei, he kept hammering, launching one campaign after another into the Central Plain. However, whenever he saw that victory was beyond his grasp, he would immediately pull his army back and head home.
There몭s no such thing as a sure victory. Instead, we should aim to not lose. 


Six ways to lose (part one): You always lose to yourself; All responsibility belongs to the commander-in-chief

Extract from the original text:
몮Now an army is exposed to six calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: (1) Flight; (2) Looseness; (3) Collapse; (4) Ruin; (5) Disorganization; (6) Rout. Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former. When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is looseness. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse. When the higher officers are angry and loose, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or not he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin. When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy몭s strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be a rout. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.몯

Analysis:
몮Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: (1) Flight; (2) Looseness; (3) Collapse; (4) Ruin; (5) Disorganization; (6) Rout.몯
This section is about the six 몬calamities,몭 or the six failures:
1) Flight:

몮Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮The force has not been measured.몯

Li Quan comments: 몮This is about not measuring force. One may use the stratagem of ambush by an auxiliary force, provided that you have obtained advantageous terrain.몯

If you try to fight a force ten times the size of your own, you haven몭t accurately assessed the balance of power. Then, the only way you몭ll be in a position to fight is if you have a terrain advantage that allows a single one of your soldiers to hold back thousands of the enemy.

2) Looseness[bd34][TT35]:

몮When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is looseness.몯

If the soldiers are tough but their officers are soft, to the point that officers몭 commands don몭t move them and discipline is limp, this is called 몬looseness.몭

During the Battle of Jifu, between the ancient states of Wu and Chu, the Chu forces teamed up with a few, small vassal states to form a seven-state allied army, which included in its ranks several minor lords. During the war, the Chu commander-in-chief, Yang Gai, fell ill and died. 몮The Chu army has been spoiled, and there is no consistency in commands and decrees; the commanders are debased and incapable of organizing the army. Lacking authority sufficient to give orders, Chu is likely to lose.몯 Thus spoke the Duke of Wu, Zi Guang. And he was right 멪 the conflict ended with a major defeat for Chu.

During the reign of Tang dynasty Emperor Muzong (795-825 CE) there was a military uprising in Zhen Prefecture. The Imperial House appointed Tian Bu as Governor of Weibo, and ordered him to deal with the rebels. Tian Bu had spent his childhood in Weibo, and the local people looked down on him and didn몭t listen to him. In his camp, many thousands of troops milled around aimlessly, and Tian Bu was unable to rein them in. After several months, it seemed like fighting was about to break out, but none of his soldiers were willing to go to battle. Helpless, Tian Bu sent a note to the Emperor, telling him about the army몭s situation and that he was powerless to do anything about it. The only thing Tian Bu had to offer was his life, and so he killed himself.

The lesson here is that if you want to put a person to work for you, not only must that person have the proper skills, he also must have authority and the ability to twist people몭s arms and make them do his bidding. If the person you choose has the skill but not the authority, he몭s only fit to work as an assistant.

3)  Collapse:

몮When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Strong officers want to advance, but if the common soldiers are weak, collapse will ensue.몯 This applies when soldiers don몭t follow behind their brave and strong commander. 몮With me!몯 the general shouts, as he charges. Behind him, though, his troops haven몭t followed. He plunges forward, alone, and into collapse.

Zhang Yu comments: 몮The general and officers are brave and desire to fight, but the common soldiery lack quality and training, rendering them unable to match their leaders몭 bravery or to fight zealously alongside them. If you use such men, you are certain to meet with collapse, death and defeat.몯

It몭s important to 몬match bravery몭 between troops and officers, and for everyone to fight alongside each other with the same, elevated energy. The general몭s duty is to train and lead soldiers, not to fight single-handed. If he can몭t properly train his men during peacetime, all his personal bravery and strength won몭t do any good on the battlefield. He몭ll find himself trapped, and collapse will inevitably follow.

4) Ruin:

몮When the higher officers are angry and loose, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or not he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮몬Higher officers몭 are assistant generals. The senior general vents rage upon them, and so in their hearts they do not respect him. Being already angry, when the time comes to attack the enemy, they do not measure the balance of power. Then, ruin is inevitable.몯 After meeting the enemy, the senior officers don몭t wait for command, and lead their men into battle under their own authority. In an army where the commander can몭t control his officers, ruin is what happens. 

Chen Hao comments: 몮This is when the commanding general behaves unreasonably and thus enrages the assistant generals. They harbor disrespect in their hearts, and because they bear grudges, they commence battle as soon as the enemy is at hand, without considering whether they can win. Therefore, they are heavily defeated.몯 When officers are disgruntled, they want to fight as soon as they catch sight of the enemy. They don몭t care whether they live or die, and they care even less about overall strategy. Feeling bitter and having lost control of their emotions, they want to fight to vent their feelings. But, it might be even more serious 멪 they might hope that their own side will lose just to humiliate their commander. 몬I remember when it was you abusing me. Well, let몭s see how things go for you now!몭 they think to themselves.몯

We몭ve already learned about the Battle for the City of Bi, which took place during the war between Jin and Chu, as both states vied to dominate China. The Jin and Chu armies were standing on opposite sides of the Yellow River. It was clear that the next battle would be decisive, and within the Jin army everyone had different opinions about whether to fight or sue for peace. The commander-in-chief, Xun Linfu, wanted to hold their position, while the Military Adjutant, Xian Gu, wanted to take the fight to the enemy. There was a fierce debate, but no conclusion. So, Xian Gu did exactly what Sun Tzu wrote about: he got angry, lost respect for his commanding officer, and because of his feelings, he started a fight on his own initiative, leading his household soldiers across the Yellow River. Xun Linfu was shocked when he heard the news. Sima Hanjue suggested mobilizing the rest of the army to prevent Xian Gu몭s force from being wiped out. And that몭s how the entire Jin army was forced to start a fight.

But, there were two other men in the Jin army who proved to be even worse than Xian Gu: Wei Qi and Zhao Zhan. At least Xian Gu thought he was trying to help his country, but these two wanted the Jin army to lose. It was, as we discussed earlier, all because Xun Linfu had refused them when they몭d asked for promotions. Now, they wanted to see Xun suffer. The two managed to get authorization from Lin to go to the Chu camp and negotiate a peace accord. But when they got there, they did the exact opposite. Instead of negotiating for peace, they picked a fight. They intentionally left Xun Linfu unprepared for the Chu surprise attack that they몭d provoked, which naturally inflicted a heavy defeat on the Jin army. That was the moment when Jin was no longer a contender in the contest to dominate China.

Xun Linfu몭s grandson, Xun Yan, also served as commander-in-chief of the Jin army, and while he was at the helm, he led a campaign against the state of Qin. When it was time to march out from Jin, he announced: 몮We ride when the cock crows; you will follow me, and me alone.몯 But this infuriated the man next to him, Lian Shu, who announced: 몮There is no man of Jin living who can give me orders like this!몯 He was in effect saying, 몬I몭m pulling my men out, and I don몭t want to have anything more to do with you.몭

Lian Shu was a powerful politician in Jin, and he was old enough to be Xun Yan몭s father.
If this is how things were done in Jin, it몭s no wonder that the state eventually fractured, resulting in new states 멪 Han, Zhao, and Wei, three of the seven major states during the Warring States period. If Jin had stayed unified, there only would have been five states, and Qin might not have been able to ultimately unify all of China.

Let몭s talk about another arrogant Jin general, Zhao Chuan. He was a through-and-through rich kid, completely reliant on his uncle Zhao Cui and his older brother, Zhao Dun. Zhao Dun was the Jin commander-in-chief when Qin invaded. His trusted advisor, Military Adjutant Yu Pian, came up with a plan. He said that the Qin army lacked staying power, and proposed taking advantage of that. 몮If we hold our position and don몭t come out to fight, they won몭t be able to last. Eventually, they몭ll pull back, and then we can hit them when they몭re 몬sluggish and inclined to return.몭 It몭ll be a complete victory.몯 Zhao Dun was completely sold on the plan, so he gave orders that nobody was allowed to go out and fight.

When it became clear that the Jin forces weren몭t going to engage, Duke Kang of Qin grew anxious. He turned to a Jin exile, Shi Hui, who had moved to Qin. The duke asked Shi Hui, 몮What몭s going on?몯 

몮This is Yu Pian몭s idea, no doubt,몯 Shi Hui replied. 몮The Jin commander-in-chief몭s younger brother, Zhao Chuan, is extremely upset that his brother promoted Yu Pian. If we pick a fight with Zhao Chuan몭s men, he몭s bound to come out and fight.몯

The Qin commander did as Shu Hui said. A force was dispatched to harass Zhao Chuan, and sure enough, Zhao Chuan came out to fight. At the time, Zhao Dun was holding a meeting. When he heard that Zhao Chuan was fighting, his only option was to mobilize the whole army and join the fray.  After all, his little brother몭s safety was at stake. 


Six ways to lose (part two): The art of choosing your vanguard

5) Disorganization:

몮When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization.몯

When a general is timid, doesn몭t manage his men strictly enough, and doesn몭t give clear instructions, his soldiers are left without a consistent framework. When it몭s time to line up for battle, the battle lines will be ragged and the troops will get in each other몭s way. This is what Sun Tzu means by 몬disorganization.몭

Zhang Yu comments: 몮The general is weak and not strict; this is what it means to speak of 몬a commander who lacks authority and moral force.몭 His instructions and communications are unclear; this is what it means to speak of 몬a commander whose commands are not informed by the methods of old.몭 There is no consistency among the officers and the soldiers; this is what it means to speak of 몬a commander who has no long-standing advisors.몭 When he lines up his soldiers, the lines are slovenly and uneven; this is what it means to speak of 몬the soldiery lacking control.몭 When a general is like this, disorganization follows.몯

A general who 몬is weak and not strict몭 has no authority or moral force.

In a company where no one has been in the job for long 멪 where everyone몭s new 멪  frankly it would be strange if disorganization and chaos weren몭t the order of the day.

6) Rout:

몮When a general, unable to estimate the enemy몭s strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be a rout.몯

The key here is: 몬place picked soldiers in the front rank.몭 This is imperative. Form a vanguard from a handpicked group of your best fighters. They will be your spearhead; they몭ll be like a dagger to plunge into the enemy. You could say that without a spearhead, all you몭re left with is a bunch of soldiers with no sharp edges.

King Wei of the state of Qi asked the strategist Sun Bin about battle theory: 몮If the ground is level and the two armies몭 personnel are evenly matched when they come together, what causes one side to be routed?몯

몮Because they had battle lines but no spearhead,몯 came Sun Bin몭s reply. Any army that makes this mistake is doomed to be defeated.

Also on this point, there몭s a passage from a chapter of the Wei Liaozi, entitled Authority in War, which reads: 몮If one fails to hand-pick warriors, one몭s entire army will be weak.몯
This line is a reminder: where is your spearhead? As a military leader, it몭s absolutely essential to have one.

Du Mu mentions in his commentary that Duke Li of Wei wrote about having a vanguard unit as part of his writings on the art of war.

We also have a detailed comment from He Shi: 몮It is always unacceptable to treat soldiers as a single entity, when they comprise soldiers who are weak and soldiers who are full of courage. Because the brave soldiers will receive no encouragement, and the weak soldiers will be able to hide themselves and thus will go into battle but not fight. Hence, defeat awaits. This is why it is written in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: 몬Neglecting to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be a rout.몭 

몮In times of old, the state of Qi derived strength from their 몬strike specialists,몭 Wei derived vigor from their 몬martial men,몭 and Qin built victory upon their 몬sharp swords.몭 There were many alternative names for 몬handpicked vanguard.몭 The Han military men had their 몬three rivers, valiant swordsmen and prodigies,몭 the Wu generals called them 몬problem-solvers,몭 the Qi generals called them 몬fate-fixers,몭 and the Tang generals called them 몬leapers and shakers.몭 Nothing comes before this in the use of military tactics. As for the talents the chosen men must possess, the senior general would order each camp to select its best fighting men, who must be unusually strong and fit in addition to being surpassingly skilled in the use of weapons. These men should be 몬organized into a separate unit몭 consisting of roughly one tenth of the army. The chosen men have few tasks; the crucial point is that they must be ready. They are the heart of the general몭s command system; they are the general몭s personal fighting force, and they also serve such tasks as fighting at the front line, setting ambushes, and so forth. Each of them must be deployed in accordance with an accurate assessment of their qualities."

If you treat all of your men as if they were the same, the best fighters won몭t get any recognition; if they think there몭s no honor to be gained, their will to fight will fade. As for the weaker men, they몭ll be able to hide their mediocrity by blending into the background and letting more capable men do the heavy lifting. They몭ll be physically present on the battlefield, but they won몭t be fighting; they몭ll be hiding behind the stronger men. That몭s why The Art of War tells us that if you don몭t have an advance unit, you몭re going to lose.

You can call this unit 몬the big guns,몭 몬the death-defiers,몭 or simply 몬the vanguard.몭 Whatever you call it, they몭ll be your cutting edge.

All the dynasties throughout Chinese history have made it a priority to build up vanguard forces, and each dynasty had a different name for these special units. During the Spring and Autumn period, they were called 몬forward marchers몭 by Jin tacticians, and 몬sharp swords몭 or 몬line-breakers몭 by Qin generals. They were known as 몬strike specialists몭 or 몬fate-fixers몭 by Qi commanders, during the Warring States period. The leaders of the state of Wei referred to them as 몬martial men,몭 while Tang strategists called them 몬fighting blades몭 and 몬leapers and shakers.몭

Judging by all these names, it몭s clear how much importance was attached to building these vanguard units. Above all else, using military force is about using these units. They account for one in ten soldiers in an army 멪 chosen from among the best men in every camp 멪 and tasked with fighting at the front line, carrying out ambushes, serving as the general몭s personal guard, and other critically important duties. They are absolutely crucial; they are the elite force that brings victory.

The Ming dynasty writer Yu Qian observed: 몮Of all the methods to prevent disgrace, none is better than training the soldiers, and the crucial part of training soldiers is to separate the strong from the weak. Thus it is written in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: 몬Neglecting to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be a rout,몭 and 몬proper governance is what brings victory in war.몭 A million men who do not obey orders are worth less than ten thousand with the will to fight; ten thousand men who do not obey orders are worth less than a hundred imbued with powerful energy. That is, the most treasured resource in war is not numbers, but spirit; much better to have a handful of spirited men than many lackluster men.몯

During the time of the Eastern Jin dynasty (316-420 CE), the Eastern Jin commander Xie Xuan faced heavy military pressure from the Former Qin dynasty. Xie Xuan picked out the most fearless warriors from among the northern nomads and put a man named Liu Laozhi in command. He proved to be an excellent leader, and he led the vanguard unit in dozens of battles, winning each and every one. His unit became known as the Northern Palace Detachment. They made their name at the Battle of Feishui after defeating Fu Jian몭s million-man army, and they were consistently the most powerful weapon in the Eastern Jin arsenal. It was from their ranks that the man who founded the Liu Song Empire, Liu Yu, first rose to power. After taking the throne, the Northern Palace Detachment became the core of the Liu Song military apparatus. 


Sun Tzu몭s professional ethics: Don몭t seek fame when you advance; don몭t avoid blame when you retreat

Guo Ziyi represents the Chinese people몭s ultimate dream, a dream thousands of years old: honor, wealth and status; good health and long life; and many, many children and grandchildren.

Extract from the original text:
몮The natural formation of the country is the soldier몭s best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated. If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler몭s bidding. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.몯

Analysis:
몮The natural formation of the country is the soldier몭s best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.몯
In war, terrain is your natural helper. The best generals accurately judge their enemy몭s plans, study the terrain and identify where it presents danger and easy travel, calculate the distances to be travelled, and draw up a battle plan. If you go into battle as a commander having understood these principles, victory is within your grasp. If you don몭t, you몭re going to lose.
Terrain is of crucial importance. In Chinese, there몭s a saying that good terrain trumps timing. However, it몭s still just a helper; having the right personnel is better than having a terrain advantage. Your human resources are your foundation. This doesn몭t mean that good terrain is worth less than having more people; it means that having people who understand the art of war is the only way you can evaluate the terrain, assess the enemy몭s situation and ultimately win the decisive battle.

몮If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler몭s bidding.몯


Depending on the situation on the ground, if victory is already certain, you can fight even if the ruler orders you not to. If it몭s clear that you몭re going to lose, you can choose not to fight even if the ruler orders you to fight. This is the same principal as before: 몬The general in the field does not always obey the sovereign몭s orders.몭

몮The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.몯

What makes this kind of person a national treasure? Zhang Yu comments: 몮A loyal servant of the state is a man who advances or retreats without regard for his own life, who never acts out of personal interests, and who does everything to protect the people and bring benefit to the sovereign; such a man is the jewel of the kingdom.몯 
He Shi comments: 몮How could it be acceptable to seek fame by advancing? Look always for what is beneficial to the state and the people, and only advance when you have seen it. How could it be acceptable to avoid blame by retreating? Upon seeing a danger that might bring disaster to the state and the people, do not advance even if the sovereign commands you. Have no regrets, even if you are tainted by disgrace.몯
As He Shi has pointed out, Sun Tzu doesn몭t just suggest that everything you do should be for the people: 몮Protect the people in everything you do; seek outcomes that align with the sovereign몭s interests.몯
Protecting your officers, soldiers and the common people is about staying alive. Don몭t throw lives away for no good reason, and remember that you need to bring home whatever helps your ruler몭s interests. There몭s a difference between the interests of the people and the interests of the ruler.
A 몬jewel of the country몭 could be described as 몬of superlative quality, honest and upright, kind, devoted and proud.몭
Being of 몬superlative quality몭 means having the ability to see the essence of things, to know whether the outcome of a conflict will be victory or defeat, and to know when to advance and when to retreat.
Being 몬honest and upright몭 means integrity is in your very bones; you몭re not just truthful and principled in certain things, but in everything you do. No matter what decision you몭re faced with, nobody in your organization, from the lowest rank to the highest, questions your motives. This is the only kind of person who has the qualifications and the space to make unilateral decisions and to act alone.
This kind person is someone who truly loves their people, their country and their subordinates, as well as their ruler. Their love is sincere and without pretense; it is a love that every person can feel emanating from them.
A 몬devoted몭 person is someone who is truly loyal to their country, and to the interests of their people and their ruler. It is not someone who is loyal only to instructions given by any one person. Because the ruler몭s instructions don몭t necessarily align with his interests, the ruler몭s judgment might be incorrect.
A 몬proud몭 person is someone who cares nothing about the fame that comes with being a 몬winner.몭 That몭s worthless to them. They have no use for yet another victory to prove their worth. When other people measure them by their victories, they just laugh.
So, who lives up to these standards? Who can rightly be called a 몬jewel of the country?몭
How about Yue Fei? Actually, no. The way Yue Fei moved his armies might have aligned with the interests of the state and the people, but not with those of the ruler, Emperor Zhao Gou. Yue Fei몭s actions could have resulted in two men both claiming to be Emperor 멪 what was Zhao Gou supposed to do about that? In the fallout after the destruction of the Northern Song dynasty, Zhao Gou had the biggest stake in the game, because he몭d become Emperor even though he wasn몭t technically 몬qualified.몭 If there were a war, the enemy Khitan state wouldn몭t even need Yue Fei to fight. They might have just released Zhao Gou몭s older brother and sent him home, which would have plunged the Emperor into a deep political crisis. There몭s not much use you can get out of a captive enemy ruler; the enemy will just choose a new ruler, and your prisoner will become worthless.
During the Ming dynasty몭s Crisis of Tumu Fortress, the Mongolian commander Esen Taishi captured Emperor Yingzong. Immediately, the Ming court installed Yingzong몭s younger brother, Chengwang, as the new ruler, known as the Jingtai Emperor. Esen Taishi no longer had any use for the Emperor he몭d captured, so for lack of better options, he sent him home, where he was put under house arrest in the Southern Palace by the Jingtai Emperor. He stayed locked up for seven years, until the Jingtai Emperor fell ill. Then, Shi Heng and his co-conspirators launched the 몬Duomen Coup몭 and restored Yingzong to the throne.
So, when Yue Fei championed the idea of bringing back 몬the second Emperor,몭 he was completely ignoring Emperor Gaozong몭s (Zhao Gou몭s) interests. Ultimately, Emperor Gaozong negotiated peace with the Khitans, who kept his older brother Qinzong in captivity but released his mother, Empress Xianren. Emperor Gaozong became the architect of the Southern Song restoration, and eventually died peacefully at the ripe old age of 81.
In the long run, the man who acted in his ruler몭s interests wasn몭t the folk hero Yue Fei, but the 몬villain,몭 Qin Hui. They were two halves of a whole: Yue Fei embodied the principle of 몬protecting the people in everything you do,몭 while Qin Hui embodied the idea of 몬seeking outcomes that align with the sovereign몭s interests.몭
There was one man who meets both requirements: protecting the people while bringing benefits to the ruler. That man was Guo Ziyi.
During the Tang dynasty몭s cataclysmic An Lushan Rebellion, Guo Ziyi was the governor of Shuofang Province. On the battlefield, he defeated Shi Siming in Hebei, and later joined forces with an ethnic Huihe army, retaking the two capital cities of Luoyang and Chang몭an. With a glowing record of service for his contribution to quelling the rebellion, he was promoted to Grand Councilor and granted the noble title of King of Fenyang. During the reign of Emperor Daizong, the traitorous general Pugu Huai몭en convinced Tibetan and Huihe forces to invade the Guanzhong plain region. Guo Ziyi made the correct strategic decision: he allied with the Huihe troops and fought against the Tibetans, and successfully upheld the peace and protected his country.
Guo Ziyi spent his whole life working as a military man, only leaving the arena for the final time at the age of 84. He racked up many amazing achievements during his career, and because of him China enjoyed peace for over 20 consecutive years. He had all the power in the world, but didn몭t provoke the imperial court몭s hostility. He was the most celebrated man of his generation, but he was never doubted by the Emperor. He enjoyed the highest esteem and prestige, throughout the land.
Holding posts at the pinnacle of the governmental hierarchy, Guo Ziyi had immense power. And yet, he always had an easy way about him, and never put up any barriers between himself and the Emperor. Certain court ministers, the type naturally given to treachery, were jealous of him and told tales that he was plotting a rebellion. They insisted to the Emperor that he summon Guo Ziyi to see whether he would obey the summons. If he didn몭t come, that would prove he would soon rebel; if he did come, they figured, they몭d have their chance to take him down. 
Guo Ziyi didn몭t delay for a second. He went immediately before the Emperor, and he went alone, with no guards. He told the Emperor that his head had always been Imperial property, and it was the Emperor몭s to take if he wished.
Guo Ziyi몭s son, Guo Ai, was given an Imperial princess as his wife, but the two used to quarrel.
몮My father is the Emperor, how dare you treat me so rudely!몯 the Princess said.
몮Who cares about the Emperor? My father doesn몭t want to be Emperor. Otherwise, the throne would be his already! Do you really think your father would have a chance?몯 Guo Ai shot back.
The princess went to the Emperor in tears and told him what Guo Ai had said. Under the rule of any of China몭s historical dynasties, his actions would have been enough to have him sentenced to death. Guo Ziyi heard about his son몭s ridiculous actions, and hurried to the palace to apologize for the young man몭s crime.
몮The boy has been quarreling and saying all manner of nonsense. What are we to do with him?몯 the Emperor said.
In the end, Guo Ziyi personally gave his son a beating. And with that, it was done.
Guo Ziyi had seven sons and eight sons-in-law, and all of them made it into high-ranking government posts. On his sixtieth birthday, all his sons and sons-in-law came to celebrate, and each carried from the Imperial court the tablets that government ministers used to record the Emperor몭s commands or comments. These they placed on their father몭s bed. The bed was covered in the tablets, and the phrase 몬a bed full of courtier몭s tablets몭 has entered the Chinese language as a reference to classical culture, meaning 몬a family that has achieved extraordinary success.몭
If you visit ancient Chinese villages, you will see tile sculptures above the doorways of old manor houses, and the story of Guo Ziyi is the most common theme of these sculptures. Guo Ziyi represents the Chinese people몭s ultimate, age-old dream: honor, wealth and status; good health and long life; and an abundance of children and grandchildren.
Love your troops like your own children; True love isn몭t easy; Not for generals, and even less so for the troops!

Extract from the original text:
몮Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.몯

Analysis:
Treat your soldiers the same way you몭d treat a baby you are raising. If you do that, you can command them to go with you into dangerous places, and they몭ll follow. You can go face-to-face with death, and know that they will be with you at your side.
During the Warring States period, the strategist Wu Qi served as a general. He shared food and clothing with even the lowest of the low among his troops. He slept on the ground without a mat to pad his body, walked rather than ride a horse, and carried his own food on his back; he shared all the physical work and all the hardship that his men experienced. In a story we recounted earlier, one of his men had an ulcer on his leg, so Wu Zi put his mouth to the wound and sucked out the puss. When the man몭s mother heard of this, she began weeping bitterly, as if in grief. 
몮The general has been so kind to your son, what are you crying for?몯 her neighbors asked her.
몮Years ago, my son몭s father also had an ulcer on his leg, and general Wu sucked his wound clean. Very soon after that, my husband died in battle. Now, General Wu has done the same thing for my son, and he too will fight and die for him,몯 the woman replied.
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Give them nurture and comfort, and they will stay close to you and never stray. Love and help them, and they will trust you and never doubt. Thus, though they may die, they will offer you their death; though they may come into peril, they will do this for you.몯
That몭s why it몭s important to sincerely care for your troops. Don몭t think that Wu Qi몭s sucking of the ulcers was just a cheap trick. If you do think that, why don몭t you try sucking on someone몭s ulcer! Without sincere, honest love for your men, and without leading them as though they were your own sons, you can never become an outstanding leader.
In He Shi몭s commentary, he writes that a benevolent approach to directing an army is what enabled General Duan Jiong to defeat the Qiang people. He personally attended to the wounded in his army, wrapping their bandages himself. Over the dozen or more years he spent living on the frontiers of the Empire, he never gave himself the luxury of a bed or even proper bedding. Whatever hardship his troops went through, so did he. That몭s what made every one of his troops glad to fight and die for him.
What about the idea that leaders should 몬lead from the front?몭
몮Soldiers toil and labor; the general must go before them. In summer he should not protect himself from the sun with awnings, and in winter he should not wear heavy clothing. When danger comes, he must take the first step. He must only drink after the soldiers몭 well is ready, he must only eat after the soldiers몭 meal is cooked, and he must only take shelter after the soldiers몭 quarters are built.몯 This is a teaching from the art of war.
This isn몭t about going through the motions a couple of times, or just for a day or two; you have to do this day after day, perhaps for decades. It isn몭t something that can be faked, and if you do manage to 몬fake it몭 for decades, you몭re not actually faking; you몭re really doing it.
Can it be done? Few indeed really and truly have the ability. 
Also in He Shi몭s commentary, he tells the story of Wang Rui, a governor of Ba Commandery under the Western Jin dynasty. Wang Rui took up the post in Ba, part of modern Sichuan Province, after Liu Bei몭s Shu Han Kingdom was wiped out by Western Jin forces. Ba Commandery bordered the kingdom of Wu, so Wang Rui was tasked with preparing for war. Soldiers and commoners were conscripted for forced labor, and the work was so grueling that many families killed or abandoned their newborn sons rather than raise them to join the workforce.
Abandoning boys is a phenomenon that happened again and again throughout Chinese history. This was because the poll tax was calculated by the number of males in each household, as was conscription for forced labor. During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty (141-87 BCE), the Emperor몭s constant wars bankrupted the country:
A passage from the ancient text, History of the Former Han Dynasty, reads: 몮Emperor Wu, to finance his campaigns against the various barbarians, imposed heavy taxation upon the people. When a family produced a son, taxation was due upon the boy몭s third birthday. So burdensome was this that some killed their sons upon their birth. What tragedy!몯
Readers know[bd36][TT37] that the modern 몬one-child policy몭 led to people killing or abandoning female babies, but many might not know that the same thing happened to male babies throughout China몭s historic succession of dynasties, all because of military conscription and taxes.
There몭s a passage from a poem by the Tang dynasty poet Du Fu that reads: 
몮We know now having boys is bad,
While having girls is for the best;
Our girls can still be married to the neighbors,
Our sons are merely buried amid the grass.몯
The true horror was even worse than the poem suggests. 
What did Wang Rui do about it when he found out this was going on? First, he gave out harsh punishments to people who abandoned or killed babies. Next, he granted maternity and paternity leave to all new parents, along with exemptions from forced labor and tax breaks. That was all it took to save thousands of baby boys! Nearly two decades passed like this, until Wang Rui raised an army and gave orders to invade the kingdom of Wu, by which point the baby boys had reached fighting age. The young men몭s mothers told them:
몮It wasn몭t us, your mother and father, who brought you into this world; it was the lord up in the palace. You must do all you can to help him, and do not hold back from giving your life!몯
So, Wang Rui, by then over 70 years old, completed his great task of destroying the kingdom of Wu and uniting the Three Kingdoms under the rule of the Western Jin dynasty.


There몭s more to fear from your high-ranking officers than from the enemy

Extract from the original text:
몮If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoiled children; they are useless for any practical purpose.몯

Analysis:
If you only know how to be soft with your men, and can몭t make them do what you want 멪 if you constantly spoil them, and can몭t make them obey your orders 멪 you won몭t be able to reel them in if they break the rules or if their discipline lapses. Then, your men will become proud and unusable.
In Du Mu몭s commentary, he quotes from Huang Shigong: 몮One may go down to one몭s men, but one may not foster arrogance.몯 You can make yourself approachable and get close to your men, and you can treat them politely. What you cannot do is give them free rein. 몬Going down to one몭s men몭 is about using kindness to cultivate your troops and behaving modestly with them; 몬Not fostering arrogance몭 is about using rules and law to control them.
There몭s a passage in a classical text, the Yinfujing, which reads: 몮Danger is born of kindness.몯 When we treat a person too well, we generally end up hurting them as well as ourselves. Why? Because you몭re always nothing but kind, nothing but loving, and you have no boundaries or rules. People get used to this, and they start to act spoiled and let themselves go. Once that happens, there몭s no way back, no matter how you try to adjust. All you can do is give up on them. Then, they lose their chance to be a part of what you몭re doing, and you몭ve wasted your time trying to make something of them.
As soon as the kindness that these people have come to expect from you is gone, they become your enemy. On what grounds do they make an enemy of you? It몭s not that you몭ve hurt them, just that you몭ve withheld your kindness. As far as you몭re concerned, all you몭ve done is stop giving them something, but they feel that you몭re taking something of theirs, something precious, away from them.
Kindness and resentment, debts of gratitude and desire for revenge; they all go together, and they are proportionate to each other. Without kindness, and without a debt of gratitude, there몭s no drive for revenge.
Wu Qi writes: 몮Drums, both on horseback and on the ground, cymbals and bells all establish authority over the ears that behold them; flags, banners and insignias establish authority over the eyes that behold them; prohibitions, commands and punishments establish authority over the minds that behold them. Sounds are used to build authority via the ears, so they must not be unclear; images are used to build authority via the eyes, so they must not be dull; punishments are used to build authority via the minds, so they must not be lax. If you do not establish these three, you inevitably shall suffer defeat at the hands of your enemy. Therefore, it is said that 몬when a general gives signals with flags, all of his soldiers without exception follow the direction indicated; when a general points, all of his soldiers without exception advance towards death.몭몯
Regular training, drills and ceremonies are all important; they strengthen the authority of your command system and get your men used to obeying commands and not doing forbidden things. This is the only way to train troops who aren몭t scared to sacrifice themselves, and who will fight wherever you point them. As soon as you point your signal flags and beat your drums, they몭ll charge without a second thought, because they know that not charging will bring dire consequences.
Duke Li of Wei wrote: 몮Those who fear me will not fear my enemies; those who fear my enemy will not fear me.몯 As a general, it몭s essential to be scarier than your enemy. You want your men to realize that they won몭t necessarily die if they charge the enemy battle lines, but there몭s no escape from the executioner if they don몭t charge when the bugle sounds.
If that doesn몭t horrify you, a passage from later on in Duke Li몭s writings might: 몮In ancient times, it was a requirement for generals to be able to kill three of every ten of their own soldiers; second-rate generals would kill one of every ten. Killing three of every ten, your authority will shake the enemy몭s country; killing one of every ten, you could effectively command an army.몯
In early antiquity, Chinese generals would kill some of their own men, not enemy hostages, before marching to war. Killing hostages 멪 like the Kangxi Emperor몭s killing of rebel general Wu Sangui몭s son 멪 isn몭t a way to establish authority, but to burn bridges. If you want to build military authority, establish military law and make sure your army obeys you, the only people you should kill are men under your command who don몭t listen to orders. As for exactly what kind of people you should select for the executioner, the best targets are those who have some favor with the Emperor. They think that nobody would dare hurt them, and this makes them careless. By killing people like this, you show your men that anyone can be killed. Execute first, tell the Emperor afterward. When you report to the Emperor when the deed몭s already done, he몭ll feel that you몭ve acted appropriately.
There are countless stories along these lines. When Sun Tzu was discussing the art of war with the King of Wu, the king handed his concubines over to Sun Tzu and instructed him to train them as soldiers. If he could turn them into a squad of battle-ready warriors, the King of Wu said, Sun Tzu would win his trust. At first, the concubines giggled and ignored Sun Tzu몭s orders, so he immediately executed the leaders, two of the king몭s most beloved concubines. After that, Sun Tzu was able to complete the women몭s training without delay.
Another classic example of this principle is Tian Rangju몭s execution of Zhuang Jia.
The states of Jin and Yan had both attacked the state of Qi, and Qi crumbled under their assault. Duke Jing of Qi then appointed Tian Rangju as a senior general, on the recommendation of his advisor, Yan Ying. The new general had an idea, and went to tell Duke Jing: 몮I am of humble birth, and now you have elevated me from a commoner to a great general. Nobody knows me, so nobody will obey me, and I shall be unable to hold together the battle lines. I ask you, my lord, please appoint one of your must trusted and senior advisors to serve as my overseer.몯 Duke Jing chose to appoint a man named Zhuang Jia.
Tian Rangju made arrangements with Zhuang Jia, and they agreed to set out at noon the next day. At the hour of departure, the army was assembled and ready, but Zhuang Jia was still drinking with his fellow senior officials, who were giving him a send-off. It was sunset by the time he arrived at the place where the army was gathered. Tian Rangju summoned a military legal official, who confirmed the punishment for reporting late to an army preparing to march 멪 execution by decapitation! The death sentence was served immediately. When Duke Jing received a report that Zhuang Jia was about to be beheaded, he dispatched an official to rush to the scene and save the condemned man. When the official arrived, Tian Rangju found him guilty of driving horses at excessive speed in a military camp, and sentenced him to death as well. However, he granted the man a reprieve on account of his status as a messenger for the Duke, and instead executed the charioteer and the left-side horse.
These executions sent shockwaves through the enemy lands, and when the Jin leaders heard about this savage man in charge of the Qi armies, they didn몭t wait to see what it would be like to fight him. They were so scared that they immediately pulled back their forces.
With the Yan armies in flight, Tian Rangju pressed his advantage and gave chase, recovering all the territory that Qi had lost.
When the Qi army returned in triumph, Duke Jing came out to greet them at the head of an escort of 100 officials. He몭d forgotten all about his advisor, Zhuang Jia! Tian Rangju was granted the title of Minister of War (몬sima몭), and that몭s how he became the famous General Sima Rangju.
Sima Rangju몭s gambit has been imitated again and again throughout history, but many times by ignorant men who neglected to study, and who ended up losing their own heads as a result.
In the final years of the Qin dynasty (221-207 BCE), Chen Sheng and Wu Guang launched an insurrection, as did Xiang Liang and Xiang Yu. Both rebellions managed to seize a few commanderies, and left chaos in their wake. Every wild, ambitious young man in the realm was itching to get involved, and a few 멪 hangers-on of  General Peng Yue 멪 went to Peng. They told him they몭d follow him if he rose up against the Emperor 몮If Chen Sheng, Wu Guang, Xiang Liang and Xiang Yu can do it, we definitely can!몯 they said. But Peng Yue refused: 몮Currently, there are two tigers in battle against each other, and it is completely unclear how the situation might develop. I don몭t want anything to do with it.몯
But, the young, would-be rebels wouldn몭t let the matter drop. They gathered together 100 or so men, determined to conquer the world with their big brother Peng Yue leading the way. Peng Yue couldn몭t get them out of his hair, and finally he gave way: 몮Alright, alright 멪 since you all are insisting on doing this, we몭ll hold our first military meeting tomorrow at dawn. Since we몭re making an army, we몭ll need a code of military laws; anyone who is late to the meeting will be decapitated!몯
The next day at noon, Peng Yue was still waiting. Finally, the last few young men began to trickle into the meeting place. Over a dozen of them were late.
몮According to military law, anyone who is late is to be decapitated, but since so many of you are late, I can몭t execute you all. So, I몭ll just execute whoever arrived last!몯
The men laughed, and asked: 몮Is that really necessary? Now, we know it won몭t happen again.몯
Peng Yue said nothing. He stepped forward, drew his sword, and beheaded the man who몭d arrived last. Everyone else was so scared they began shaking; they didn몭t dare look Peng in the eye. Then, Peng built a simple, earthen altar and offered up the man몭s severed head as a sacrifice.
Peng Yue became a powerful figure in the region, and after throwing his weight behind Liu Bang he was eventually made a senior official in the new Western Han regime.
Today, when we talk of official corruption, there몭s this idea in China that 몬unless we fight corruption, the country will fall; if we do fight corruption, the party will fall.몭 This is a talking point used by people who don몭t want to do anything to stop corruption. Actually, not fighting corruption is what will bring down the party. It몭s not true that the party won몭t have any officials left to do its work if all the corrupt officials are rounded up. In fact, this will only bring the party more strength and vitality.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Neither kindness nor punishments may be used exclusively. If you show only kindness, then the soldiers will become arrogant and useless. If you show only punishments, then the soldiers will not be close to you, which will also render them useless. The kingly way to manage soldiers is to use both kindness and punishments, thus establishing grace and authority simultaneously.몯
There몭s also a passage from the Wei Liaozi that reads: 몮If you do not use love to make their hearts willing, then they are useless to you. If you do not use authority to make their hearts fearful, then they cannot be commanded by you.몯 
For generals, the art of commanding men consists of love and fear 멪 it몭s a matter of rewards and punishments.
What is the essence of fear? 몮Those who fear me shall not fear my enemy; those who fear my enemy shall not fear me.몯 If men are scared of their commanding officers, they won몭t be scared of their enemies, they won몭t be scared of death, and vice versa. So, we have clear criteria for what constitutes 몬fear몭멪 as a general, you have to be scarier than your enemies.


몬Knowing yourself and your enemy몭 according to Emperor Taizong: If you don몭t have the skill to understand others, make sure you know yourself

As long as you know yourself, you can몭t lose. Where people go wrong isn몭t that they don몭t understand other people; it몭s that they don몭t know themselves.

Extract from the original text:
몮If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, prospects for victory stand at one half. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, prospects for victory stand at one half. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, prospects for victory still stand only at one half. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; at his disposal is an endless array of possible actions. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.

Analysis:
몮If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, prospects for victory stand at one half.몯
In this scenario, you understand yourself, but not your enemy. You know your army is ready to fight, but you don몭t know that the enemy is also very strong, and you won몭t necessarily be able to get the best of them. So, your odds of victory are fifty-fifty.

몮If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, prospects for victory stand at one half.몯

If you몭ve identified a vulnerability in the enemy that you can strike, but you don몭t realize your men aren몭t up to the task, you won몭t necessarily be able to win. In this scenario, you understand your enemy, but not yourself. Your odds of victory are still fifty-fifty.
In both scenarios, there몭s no certainty of victory.
Emperor Taizong wrote: 몮Whenever I stand with serried ranks facing my enemy, I first evaluate the enemy몭s thoroughness and prudence, and mine also, and so I am able to know my enemy in this way. I observe the degree to which my enemy몭s energy has been cultivated, and mine also, and so I am able to understand myself. This is how I come to know both my enemy and myself; this is indispensable for any military leader. If the officials and advisors of today only know themselves, even without knowing the enemy this is still enough that they will not easily be defeated.몯
Emperor Taizong was able to see through his enemies, and he also had a clear understanding of himself. Even in midst of a dynamic, developing situation, he was able to grasp and manipulate both his army and his enemy몭s forces, including shifts in both armies몭 morale and mood. By doing this, he could create opportunities for certain victory. But, he also says that if you don몭t have the ability to do all this, you don몭t have to completely understand your enemy. In other words, as long as you have a clear understanding of yourself, you can몭t lose. 
This is Emperor Taizong몭s view on 몬knowing yourself and your enemy몭 멪 if you don몭t have the skill to understand other people, make sure you know yourself. I feel very much the same way. Generally, when we try to learn about 몬knowing yourself and your enemy,몭 we focus entirely on how to understand other people, thinking that of course we have a good understanding of ourselves. But, in reality, people usually go wrong because they don몭t correctly understand themselves, and not because they can몭t understand other people. The same is true in business. Don몭t focus exclusively on learning about the so-called 몬competition,몭 because it몭s not particularly useful to know what other people are doing. You need to know what your customers need and what you몭re capable of doing.

몮If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, prospects for victory still stand only at one half.몯

It몭s not enough to know yourself and your enemy; you also have to know the terrain.

몮Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; at his disposal is an endless array of possible actions.몯

You몭ve already seen and thoroughly considered all the factors in play before you take action, so you can몭t become confused. You know yourself and your enemy, and you know where the advantage of terrain and timing are, so you can take any change in your stride and adapt without breaking step. You몭ll never find yourself without a plan.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮He does not move recklessly, and thus when he does move, he makes no mistake. He does not take action lightly, and thus when he does take action, he does not find himself in difficulties. He learns the weaknesses and strengths of himself and the enemy, and he gains the advantage of expeditious terrain. Only then does he fight.몯


몮Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.몯

So, if you know yourself and your enemy, you can win without danger; if you understand the advantages of terrain and timing, victory is completely guaranteed.


Appendix: Complete text of Terrain

Sun Tzu said: 몮We may distinguish six kinds of terrain: (1) Accessible ground; (2) Entangling ground; (3) Temporizing ground; (4) Narrow passes; (5) Precipitous heights; (6) Positions at a great distance from the enemy. Ground that can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible. With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, benefiting your line of supplies. Then you will be able to fight with advantage. Ground that can be abandoned but is hard to reoccupy is called entangling. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue. Ground that can be abandoned but is hard to reoccupy is called entangling. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue. When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called temporizing ground. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage. With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, fill them up and await the advent of the enemy. Should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned. With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting will be to your disadvantage. These six are the principles connected with Earth. The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them. Now an army is exposed to six calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: (1) Flight; (2) Looseness; (3) Collapse; (4) Ruin; (5) Disorganization; (6) Rout. Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the flight of the former. When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is looseness. When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse. When the higher officers are angry and loose, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or not he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin. When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy몭s strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be a rout. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post. The natural formation of the country is the soldier몭s best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated. If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler몭s bidding. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoiled children; they are useless for any practical purpose. If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, prospects for victory stand at one half. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, prospects for victory stand at one half. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, prospects for victory still stand only at one half. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; at his disposal is an endless array of possible actions. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.몯

몮The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) Facile ground; (3) Contentious ground; (4) Open ground; (5) Ground of intersecting highways; (6) Serious ground; (7) Difficult ground; (8) Hemmed-in ground; (9) Desperate ground. When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground. When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground. Ground the possession of which imparts great advantage to either side is contentious ground. Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground. Ground that forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has the world at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground. Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens 멪 all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed-in ground. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay is desperate ground. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy몭s way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies. On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight.

Analysis:
Cao Cao comments: 몮There are nine types of terrain where battle may be desirable.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Among all the terrain types where war may be waged, there are nine attendant energies. Here, the subject matter is the energy pertaining to terrain; hence, this chapter follows after the chapter entitled Terrain.몯
This chapter is about the 몬energy pertaining to terrain몭 멪 the various features of a battlefield. It mainly revolves around how deep one몭s army has entered into enemy territory; the state of relations with neighbors; your psychological condition and that of the enemy; the disparity in overall support available to yourself and your enemy; and what strategic action plans are used under different 몬terrain energies.몭


몮The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) Facile ground; (3) Contentious ground; (4) Open ground; (5) Ground of intersecting highways; (6) Serious ground; (7) Difficult ground; (8) Hemmed-in ground; (9) Desperate ground.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮These are the names of the nine types of terrains.몯
According to the laws of warfare, there are nine terrain types that strongly impact on the strategy of the fighters:
1) Dispersive ground:

몮When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground멞 On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not.몯

Where does this term, 몬dispersive ground몭 come from? Why is it used to describe a situation where a leader is fighting on his own territory? Cao Cao comments: 몮One몭s soldiers are attached to this ground; the roads are short and it is easy for one몭s army to disperse.몯 When you fight close to home, your men will slip through your hands and go home if you don몭t keep control of them. It몭s easy for your men to lose focus, and if that happens your army can easily collapse.

Li Quan comments: 몮Soldiers long for their home ground and they miss their wives and children; if they become anxious then they will disperse. This is 몬dispersive ground.몭몯

Du Mu comments: 몮The soldiers being close to their homes, they will not be committed to death in their minds as they advance, and they will be mindful that a place of refuge awaits if they only retreat.몯

What are the principles for waging war on dispersive ground? Sun Tzu writes: 몮On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not.몯 Don몭t get into a fight lightly.

Jia Lin comments: 몮One must not fight too many times.몯 If you must fight, finish the job in a single move.

The King of Wu once asked Sun Tzu: 몮Since it is inadvisable to fight on dispersive ground, one is compelled to hold fast in a defensive position, and to not come out. But what ought I do if my enemy attacks the small towns of my kingdom, if he plunders my fields and forests, if he prevents me from gathering firewood, if he blocks my roads, and if he waits for me to be weakened before launching a rapid strike?몯

Sun Tzu replied: 몮If the enemy enters deep into your territory, his fighting spirit is concentrated and he will easily engage in combat. Your soldiers are close to their homes, so your battle lines will lack solidity and you will not prevail in battle. Instead, you should assemble your people and gather up your grain, protect your fortified cities and prepare to hold strategic locations with dangerous terrain; then, dispatch light forces to sever the enemy몭s supply lines. The enemy will be unable to provoke you into fighting, his supplies will not reach him, he will be unable to plunder the countryside, and his forces will suffer deprivations. Thus, you may lure him after observing his condition, and you will have a chance to succeed. If you desire to fight in open country, you must base your designs upon the energy of terrain and set ambushes in locations with dangerous terrain. If there is no dangerous terrain, conceal yourself in the shadows and emerge when the enemy does not expect you and strike when he is sluggish.몯

Raiding parties manned by the peoples of the north repeatedly invaded China throughout the ages, and pretty much any time the marauders breached the Great Wall, the Chinese defenders used the strategy outlined above. The Chinese forces would shrink back and stay inside Beijing몭s city walls. The invaders would plunder and loot the surrounding countryside for a while, without much to show for their efforts, until soldiers loyal to the Emperor would coalesce from around China and march towards Beijing.  At that point, the invaders would retreat north. Alternatively, if the Emperor couldn몭t stand his honor being tarnished, he would inevitably send an army out to fight. This approach typically ended in disaster.

During the Ming dynasty몭s Crisis of Tumu Fortress, Emperor Yingzong personally led an enormous army of 200,000 troops into battle against the Mongol leader, Essen. His army was annihilated at Tumu Fortress, and he was captured alive. An official named Yu Qian rose to face the crisis, and was given the authority to lead the imperial response. First, he ordered all government officials in Tongzhou to withdraw their salaries and empty all of the grain stores, so they wouldn몭t fall into Essen몭s hands. Meanwhile, Essen was scything a path towards Beijing, right up to the base of the city walls. Defending the city was a force of 220,00 men under the personal command of Yu Qian, who had taken up sword and shield to protect Beijing. He inflicted heavy defeats on Essen, first at Desheng Gate and then at Xizhi Gate, and Essen몭s younger brother was killed in the fighting.

Unable to breach Beijing몭s walls and with no loot within his reach, the Mongols몭 morale was low after successive defeats. At the same time, soldiers from all over China were now on their way to save Beijing. Essen couldn몭t stay where he was 멪 he was standing on hot coals. So, he broke camp and beat a retreat. Yu Qian came out and pursued him while he was 몬sluggish and inclined to return,몭 hitting him with cannon fire. He roundly beat Essen two more times, once at Gu몭an (famous now for the slogan 몬Gu몭an, 50 km due south from Tiananmen 멪 I love Beijing!몭), and once at Bazhou (the 몬Hot Spring Town몭), and captured eighteen high-ranking Mongol generals.

2) Facile ground:

몮When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground멞 On facile ground, halt not.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮It is easy for the soldiers to return home.몯

Li Quan comments: 몮This is terrain which facilitates retreat.몯

Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Having entered no great distance into enemy territory, the road home is short and it is easy to return.몯

There몭s not much difference between dispersive ground and facile ground. On dispersive ground, you몭re practically standing in the doorway of your home; as soon as your men몭s fighting spirit slips, home is where they몭ll go. Meanwhile, on facile ground you몭re standing in your enemy몭s doorway, but you몭re still not far from your own home. Here, the idea of pressing forward is scary; you don몭t know what dangers lie ahead. But, you know that pulling back is an easy option, and that you몭ll be safe once you몭re back in your own country.

So, facile ground is also a terrain type where your men몭s fighting spirit will be weak. What is there to do about it? 몮On facile ground, halt not.몯 Don몭t linger.

Du Mu comments: 몮That which is called 몬facile ground몭 in The Art of War is terrain where one has entered not far past the enemy frontier, before the point where dangerous terrain may be pressing against you from behind; it is terrain where the soldiers몭 minds are preoccupied with thoughts of returning home, where it is difficult to advance and easy to retreat; it is a place where the most difficult thing is to move deeper in. One must select the best cavalry soldiers at one몭s disposal and dispatch them in secret to lay an ambush; when enemy soldiers arrive, strike without hesitation; if the enemy soldiers do not come, then quickly depart.몯

If enemy troops come to you, for them it is dispersive ground, and their fighting spirit will be even weaker than your own! So, strike immediately. If they don몭t come, move through quickly 멪 don몭t linger, and make sure your men drop their anxiety about leaving home as quickly as possible. Make them let go of any wishful thinking they might have about a quick return. 

The King of Wu once asked Sun Tzu: 몮What is to be done if the soldiers are preoccupied with thoughts of returning home, if it is difficult to advance but easy to retreat, if one does not yet have one몭s back up against dangerous terrain, and if the minds of one몭s men are filled with dread?몯

Sun Tzu replied: 몮When the army is situated on facile ground, the soldiers몭 minds are not concentrated. Your task is to advance; do not seek battle. To this end, do not move close to major enemy cities; do not travel by their major transportation routes. Establish decoy units and feign confusion, and give the impression that you are on the verge of departing. Then select an elite group of cavalry soldiers, attack them where they are weak and seize their livestock; when the rest of your forces see this, they will no longer fear moving forward. Split off some good soldiers from your army and secretly install them in an ambush position; if the enemy comes, strike without hesitation. If the enemy does not come, abandon the ambush position and move onward.몯

When you몭ve only just crossed the enemy몭s border, your men haven몭t yet had a chance to get into a war mentality. This is an extremely frightening situation. It몭s best not to fight if you can help it; don몭t bite off more than you can chew, don몭t attack any cities, and don몭t travel along major roads, because they will be guarded by enemy troops. Send out decoy troops to confuse the enemy, and then plunge ahead with elite vanguard units, find easy targets for them, and go looting around the countryside. When the rest of your men see this, they몭ll think that you몭re winning the war! Their spirits will rise, and they won몭t be frightened anymore. At the same time, split off some of your men and use them to set ambushes. If the enemy comes, move at once and hit them where it hurts. If they don몭t come, move onward as quickly as possible; don몭t wait around. 

When making plans and coming up with tactics for fighting on facile ground, put into practice three art of war philosophies that we몭ve already learned about: 1) Manage energy; pay attention to your men몭s psychological state, and engineer a small victory to put some wind in their sails and lend them some courage. 2) Select troops to form a vanguard unit; rank-and-file troops will be scared, so choose some who aren몭t afraid to be your spearhead. Give them the task of winning some victories, seizing some loot and drumming up your army몭s morale. 3) Use the art of division 멪 몬Use the regular to engage the enemy, and the irregular to defeat him.몭 While your main force rapidly makes its way forward, your vanguard wins some cheap victories by picking easy targets, while another auxiliary force sets an ambush in coordination with your other movements as defense against an enemy attack.


How to fight battles in the 몬Nine terrain types몭 (part two): The crucial thing about strength is willpower

What we see when we look at how the art of war applies to dispersive ground, facile ground and contentious ground is that everything revolves around the element of psychology. It몭s all about the two sides몭 relative mental strength, and how each side manages energy.
The crucial thing about strength is willpower.

Extract from the original text:
몮Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground멞 On contentious ground, attack not.몯

Analysis:
3) Contentious ground:

몬Contentious ground몭 is the kind of terrain that military strategists fight to control and which offers an advantage to whoever seizes possession of it first. As to why, Cao Cao has the answer: 몮Here the few can defeat the many, and the weak can strike the strong.몯 So, if your enemy gets hold of 몬contentious ground,몭 don몭t insist on fighting him there.

Li Quan comments: 몮This is about holding dangerous terrain such as narrow passes and defiles; victory belongs to whoever holds it first; such is 몬contentious ground.몭몯 

Du Mu includes a historical case study in his comment. Before the Battle of Feishui, Fu Jian sent Lu Guang, one of his high-ranking generals, to invade the western regions. Lu Guang subdued the armed opposition he met there, and returned east with a huge consignment of treasure and other goods. However, by that point Fu Jian had already suffered a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Feishui. After Fu Jian몭s fall, the regional generals of the Former Qin dynasty held total military power, and each one of them had his own ideas about what to do with it. When Lu Guang arrived at Yizhu (present-day Anxinan, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region), the Former Qin governor of Liang Province, Liang Xi, wanted to seal off his region몭s roads, and refused to let Lu Guang in.

The governor of Gaochang, a man named Yang Han, said to Liang Xi: 몮Lu Guang is newly returned from his conquest of the western regions; his army is strong and he bears an acutely sharp energy. Now that he has heard of the chaos reigning in the Central Plain, he is sure to have his own designs. He holds a vast expanse of land west of the river, and his army boasts 100,000 armored warriors; he is well placed to defend himself. And if he chooses to come out from the land of sands, his momentum will be hard to oppose. There is a location at the entrance to the Gaowu River Valley, a place of narrow and dangerous terrain. We should hold it and thus deprive him of a water source, and thus he will become tired and thirsty, and we will be able to best him even without moving. If you consider the Gaowu Valley to be too far away, then we can also hold him off at Yiwu Pass. This is a location that must be contended for, because it would offer Guang a great opportunity. If he passes through these two places, even though we have Zifang몭s stratagem, we will be unable to use it.몯 

But, Liang Xi refused to take Yang Han몭s advice.

This is precisely the essence of 몬contentious ground몭 멪 the mouth of the Gaowu River Valley and Yiwu Pass were the two places containing terrain where Lu Guang could have been stopped. When Lu Guang received reports from his spies telling of Yang Han몭s plan, he was deeply concerned. But then, his advisor Du Jin told him: 몮Liang Xi has talent in spades when it comes to the gentle arts, but he lacks pragmatism. He will not listen to Yang Han. For us, the advantage lies in advancing rapidly; we must not delay. I assure you, if Liang Xi does go along with Yang Han몭s plan, I will cut off my own head and present it to you as a gift.몯

Just as Du Jin predicted, Liang Xi decided that the Gaowu River Valley and Yiwu Pass were too far away. So, he sent 50,000 men to block the road at Jiuquan. Meanwhile, Lu Guang몭s army was rapidly covering the great distance toward the eastern regions. Yang Han was the first regional leader to surrender, followed by the governors of Dunhuang and Jinchang. In the end, Lu Guang captured and beheaded Liang Xi and then established the Empire of Later Liang.

We몭ve seen that no army camp is short of wise advisors, but if the lord can몭t understand what they몭re telling him, there몭s nothing to be done. For example, in Han Xin몭s Battle of Jingxing, his opponent, Chu Yu, refused to listen when his advisor Lord Guangwu suggested blocking off Jingxing Pass. So, Han Xin defeated the Zhao army, beheaded Chu Yu and took Lord Guangwu prisoner. Han Xin treated Lord Guangwu courteously and told him that if Chu Yu had used his plan, there was no way things would have worked out the way they did. So, Lord Guangwu switched sides and began to work for Han Xin. The same thing happened with Yang Han 멪 when he saw that his superior wasn몭t going to listen to him or use his plan, he knew that it was over. He was the first to surrender when Lu Guang몭s army arrived.

The King of Wu once asked Sun Tzu: 몮What should be done if the enemy arrives first, occupies the advantageous terrain, drills his soldiers there, and is able to either come out or hold his position in order to prevent me from effectively using auxiliary forces?몯

Sun Tzu replied: 몮As regards the methods to be used in contentious ground, the advantage belongs to whoever seizes it first. If the enemy holds contentious ground, be cautious and do not attack. Draw him out and feign retreat; plant flags and sound your drums, attract his attention using things that are precious to him, drag firewood about to raise up dust clouds, confuse his ears and eyes, and select your best soldiers and secretly set an ambush. The enemy is bound to come out; go to the places towards which he harbors desire and take that which he discards. This is the art of contentious ground. If you arrive first and the enemy seeks to use this strategy against you, then select your best soldiers and form a light unit to pursue him; meanwhile, hold your original position and establish ambushes in locations with dangerous terrain. Then, if the enemy returns to fight, your ambush unit will leap forth from the flanks. This is the way to total victory.몯

Here, Sun Tzu clearly explains how to deal with this situation, from the position of both the attacker and the defender. 

His principles of fighting on contentious ground were put into practice by Li Shimin 멪 who eventually became Emperor Taizong of Tang 멪 when he defeated Dou Jiande at the Battle of Hulao Pass.

Amidst the pandemonium of the final years of the Sui dynasty, strongmen all over China were running around chasing power. Wang Shichong had occupied the ancient capital of Luoyang and proclaimed himself Emperor of the state of Zheng. Meanwhile, north of the Yellow River, Dou Jiande had proclaimed himself Emperor of the state of Xia. Li Shimin, at the head of over 30,000 Tang troops, surrounded Wang Shichong몭s Luoyang, and the two sides engaged in vicious combat for eight months. Wang Shichong was relentless, and the conflict left both sides utterly exhausted. It was then that Dou Jiande began to march with a massive army of 100,000 men to rescue Wang Shichong. Dou Jiande was a capable and battle-hardened warrior 멪 even if Li Shimin pulled back and tried to re-gather his forces for another attempt, nobody could blame him. On the other hand, if he left he몭d be wasting all the hard work that had so nearly brought Luoyang within his grasp. Also, if Zheng and Xia joined forces, they몭d be able to take the fight deep inside his own territory.  And yet, Li Shimin saw a chance to wipe out his two formidable opponents in one fell swoop. It would rely on using an area he몭d identified as contentious ground: Hulao Pass.

So, Li Shimin left Li Yuanji in command of the siege of Luoyang, while he led a tiny force of 3,500 cavalry on an all-day and all-night journey straight to Hulao Pass. He made it there just before Dou Jiande. By the time he finished setting up his position, Dou Jiande몭s forces were only 30 li away.

The next day, Li Shimin sprang a small-scale ambush on the Xia army and succeeded in blunting his enemy몭s momentum. He led 500 cavalry soldiers out of the pass and ordered two officers, Qin Shubao and Cheng Yaojin, to lay an ambush. Meanwhile, he and another officer, Yuchi Jingde, went with only four soldiers to the Xia camp to provoke them. They lured several thousand enemy cavalry straight into an ambush, crushing the Xia force and capturing two of its senior generals.

As we몭ve already mentioned in the sections on 몬dispersive몭 and 몬facile몭 ground, even though on the face of it we몭re talking about terrain, it몭s actually all about psychological warfare, or 몬managing energy.몭 You need to manage your own army몭s energy, but you also need to manage the enemy army몭s energy. Dou Jiande몭s army was massive 멪 100,000 men 멪 and it was bearing down with the momentum of an avalanche. By comparison, Li Shimin몭s 30,000-strong Tang army was tiny; it would be difficult for his men not to be deeply nervous about their chances of victory. But, Li Shimin didn몭t delay for a second. Before the enemy could establish themselves, he swiftly went to the front lines in person, and scored a victory. This boosted his men몭s morale while shaking that of his enemies.

And that몭s how Li Shimin held Dou Jiande off. Hulao Pass is a place that can be held by a single warrior against 10,000, and Li Shimin stalled his enemies there for over a month. Occasionally, he would send out a fast-moving force to pick off some of the enemy, and the Xia army was powerless to breach the pass.

Li Shimin몭s spies fanned out over the land, enabling him to seize opportunities. He also sent a 1,000-strong cavalry force to disrupt the Xia supply route, and in the process they stole all of the Xia grain wagons. Once that happened, the Xia army몭s situation took a sharp turn for the worse and their morale sank ever lower.

After tormenting his enemy for over a month, Li Shimin decided that he몭d done his job. As a smokescreen, he let it be known that the Tang army was going to put its horses out to graze, meaning that his cavalry would be without the use of their mounts. Dou Jiande mobilized his entire army, hoping to use this opportunity to deal with Li Shimin once and for all. At dawn, the Xia army was lined up, but noon came and went and still there was no sign of a battle starting. The soldiers were hungry and tired. Meanwhile, Li Shimin had re-gathered his war horses and launched a sudden, all-out strike. His 3,500 cavalry troops shattered the 100,000-strong Xia army몭s lines, and on that day he captured Dou Jiande himself. He put Dou Jiande in a cage on wheels and took him to the foot of the Luoyang city walls, where he shouted for Wang Shichong to come and look: 몮Your reinforcements are here!몯 When Wang Shichong saw this, he suffered a total breakdown. He came out from behind his city walls and offered his surrender.

Li Shimin asked Dou Jiande: 몮What business was it of yours that I was fighting with Wang Shichong? What made you come running from so far away just to skewer yourself on my sword?몯

Dou Jiande tried to ingratiate himself: 몮I just didn몭t want you to go to the bother of coming all the way to get me, so I delivered myself to you instead.몯 Clearly, his energy was utterly depleted 멪 how could a war hero, a man who called himself Emperor, speak in such a way?

So, what we see when we look at how the art of war applies to dispersive ground, facile ground and contentious ground is that everything revolves around the element of psychology. It몭s all about the two sides몭 relative mental strength, and how each side manages energy.

The crucial thing about strength is willpower.

How to wage war in the 몬Nine terrain types몭 (part three): Ally with 몬third parties몭

Extract from the original text:
몮Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground. (멞 on open ground, do not allow severance.) Ground that forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has the world at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways. (멞 on the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.) When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground. (멞 on serious ground, gather in plunder.)몯

Analysis:
4) Open ground:

몮Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮This is where roads intersect.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮Rivers are wide and the ground is level, such that one may come or go at will; it provides adequate conditions to fight a battle.몯

Du You comments: 몮Open ground is a place transected by multiple roads; it is impossible to block movement here.몯

He Shi comments: 몮Open ground is a flat, navigable plain; one may travel great distances in all four cardinal directions, and it is impossible for movement to be blocked.몯

Open ground is an area of open space, with no dangerous terrain features and roads that stretch out in all directions. Even without roads, it몭s possible to travel freely and meet no resistance. If this is a terrain type you can travel through easily, the same is true for your enemy; nobody can stand in anybody몭s way here.

So, what is the principle of waging war on open ground? Sun Tzu tells us: 몮On open ground, do not try to allow obstacles to movement.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮One몭s component parts must be joined to one another.몯 Every part of your forces needs to stay joined up, with no gaps in between. If there are gaps, it몭s easy for the enemy to split up your forces and either cut off the head of your army or surround you and prevent you from reattaching your head to your body, as it were. 

Du Mu comments: 몮Rivers are wide and the ground is level; battle may be joined from any direction, and so one must combine chariots, cavalry and infantry into a single, connected unit so as to prevent the enemy from severing the parts of your forces and for fear that the enemy will take advantage.몯

Wang Xi comments: 몮It is beneficial for grain supply routes. Ground which is expeditious for coming and going can also be referred to as 몬easily navigable ground.몭 Occupy an elevated, sunny location, and await the enemy there. You should ensure that your grain supply routes are not severed.몯

It is not a set-in-stone requirement that your army must not be separated. When Sun Tzu says 몬on open ground, do not allow severance,몭 he means that you shouldn몭t allow your forces to be cut off. He몭s not saying that you absolutely must keep all parts of your army together, with no separation at all. For example, to secure your grain supply routes, you will need to send some of your troops out to guard the roads. In order to occupy high, sunny ground, it might also be necessary to split off part of your army and set it up somewhere else, where the terrain enables you to coordinate the different parts of your army into a pincer formation. Taking the initiative to divide your army is not 몬severance.몭  Rather, it requires you to pay attention and not allow gaps to open up between your various units while on the march. You need to be able to use the different parts of your army as a coordinated whole, keep communication open, and don몭t give the enemy any openings to exploit.

The King of Wu once asked Sun Tzu: 몮If I desire to sever the enemy몭s forces on open ground and render him unable to move, I must order my frontier cities to prepare their defenses, I must fully sever transportation routes, and I must fortify areas of narrow terrain. But what is to be done if my planning is not timely and the enemy is already prepared, and being prepared, he is able to come to me and I am unable to move, and if our forces are evenly matched in number?몯

Sun Tzu replied: 몮Since you are unable to move, and since the enemy is able to come, you can take a part of your army and conceal it. Meanwhile, remain behind your defenses and take your ease, showing yourself to be incapable. When the enemy arrives, set a hidden ambush and spring it such that he is taken by surprise.몯

5) Ground of intersecting highways:

몮Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has the world at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.몯

This terrain type is quite simple to understand. 몬Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states몭 just means a place where the borders of three countries meet. It몭s a place where, as a Chinese saying puts it, 몬Roosters can be heard in three provinces.몭 The city of Quzhou, in Zhejiang Province, takes it one step further 멪  four provinces share borders there: Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui. The city of Quzhou is a transportation and distribution hub for all four provinces, making it a 몬super-intersection.몭 This is also the source of the city몭s name: the 몬Qu몭 (쾦) in[bd38] Quzhou means 몬intersection.몭 It has been dubbed 몬the four-province intersection and the source of the five roads.몭

What is the reasoning behind the next part: 몮He who occupies it first has the world at his command?몯 Here, 몬the world몭 stands for the feudal states of ancient China. The parties involved aren몭t just limited to your country and your enemy몭s; there몭s also a third country. Whoever arrives first can form an alliance with that third country and gain their assistance. Then, the war turns into two against one, increasing your odds of victory. This is why Sun Tzu writes: 몮He who occupies it first has the world at his command.몯 The strategy to use in this terrain type is to get your diplomacy right; build alliances with other countries.

Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Your forces being evenly matched with the enemy몭s, and being situated where neighboring countries converge on three sides, whoever arrives first will acquire the aid of the other country.몯

The King of Wu once asked Sun Tzu: 몮It being vital to arrive first at ground of intersecting highways, what is to be done if I am unable to arrive first due to the distance to be travelled, and despite driving my chariots and horses forward at high speed?몯

Sun Tzu replied: 몮States adjoin one another, and they are connected to one another in all directions. Your forces and those of your enemy being equivalent, and if there is another neighboring country, then he who is referred to as 몬arriving first몭 must be he who first sends messengers with a heavy load of treasures to negotiate an accord with that neighboring country. Having established close ties and favor, then the peoples of the two countries are already linked, even though your army shall arrive later. Thus, you have the support of many people, while the enemy has lost the chance for an alliance; two countries poised either side of the enemy, you then attack amidst a thundering of drums, reducing the enemy to shock and terror and utterly without recourse.몯

Arriving first doesn몭t always mean that your army reaches a certain location before the enemy; it몭s about making sure your envoys get there first. With a generous haul of gifts and all the proper courtesies, you can secure an alliance before your enemy has a chance. Then, it doesn몭t matter if your army arrives after the enemy. You attack alongside your new ally, and your enemy is powerless to stop you. This is the true meaning of that line from Chapter Three, Planning Assaults: 몮Thus the highest form of generalship is to attack the enemy몭s plans; the next best is to attack the enemy몭s alliances멞몯

6) Serious ground:

Extract from the original text:

몮When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground멞 On serious ground, gather in plunder.몯


Analysis:

Cao Cao comments: 몮This is terrain from which it is difficult to return.몯 Serious ground is the opposite of facile ground; once you몭re deep inside serious ground, meaning deep within enemy territory, with a good number of enemy cities already behind you, it becomes very difficult to go back to your home country.

Li Quan comments: 몮These are places of firm resolve.몯 When it몭s difficult to go back the way you came, you give up on the idea of going home and stop thinking about it altogether. Your mind becomes focused, and your willpower grows steady and strong. Two examples of 몬entering deep into serious ground몭 are Bai Qi몭s invasion of the state of Chu and Yue Yi몭s invasion of the state of Qi.

What should you do if you find yourself in serious ground? 몮Gather in plunder.몯 Steal what you can; seize grain and other supplies, because you몭re already beyond the reach of resupply missions from your own country.

The King of Wu once asked Sun Tzu: 몮Suppose I have drawn my army deep into serious terrain and I have travelled through much enemy territory, and my grain supply routes have been severed. I desire to return to my country, but I am constrained by circumstances; what should I do that I may eat my enemy몭s food and maintain my army without suffering loss?몯

Sun Tzu replied: 몮Whenever you are situated in serious terrain, your soldiers are easily emboldened. If your transportation routes are impeded, then you can secure food supplies by plundering. Soldiers who acquire grain and fine goods must deliver their plunder in its entirety to their superiors; those who render the largest quantity shall be rewarded, and thus your soldiers will have no thoughts of returning home. If you truly desire to return to your country, then make defensive preparations; dig deep trenches and erect high walls to show the enemy that you intend to stay for a long time. Thus, the enemy will suspect that some other transportation route remains open to you, and so he will secretly remove his soldiers from the main roads. Then, order your light chariots to move swiftly and silently. Use your oxen and horses as bait, and if the enemy comes, sound your drums and pursue him. Having concealed your soldiers in ambush, when the enemy triggers the ambush, attack from two sides at once. If you do this, the enemy몭s defeat is certain.몯

When you몭re deep inside 몬serious몭 enemy terrain, the most important thing is that you take supplies from your enemy. However, your enemy will also be aware of this principle and might burn everything rather than leave anything for you. When Napoleon fought his way into Moscow, if the city had been full of supplies and comfortable living quarters, he could have stayed there and waited for the Tsar to surrender. But, the Russians burned Moscow down with a single torch. The French army tried to put out the fire, but they found that all of the city몭s fire-fighting equipment had been sabotaged. In the trajectory of Napoleon몭s fall, the Great Fire of Moscow was a major turning point.


How to wage war in the 몬Nine terrain types몭 (part four): Move rapidly through dangerous terrain

Extract from the original text:
몮Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens 멪 all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground. (... in difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.)몯

Analysis:
7) Difficult ground:

Jia Lin comments: 몮Passing through terrain ravaged by water 멪 this is called 몬difficult ground.몭몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮This is about places with few solid features.몯

He Shi comments: 몮몬Difficult ground몭 refers to places with few solid features, where it is not possible to build fortified walls or dig deep moats; one should make haste to leave such places behind.몯

What몭s the right thing to do in difficult ground? 몮In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.몯 With nothing but water-logged ground beneath you, these are places where it몭s impossible to secure yourself, and impossible to build fortifications or any other construction works. You can몭t camp there either; all you can do is make your way through this terrain as quickly as possible. Don몭t stop.

The King of Wu once asked Sun Tzu: 몮Suppose I have entered difficult ground, where I am faced with mountains, rivers, and all manner of dangerous and obstructive terrain, such that the road is hard to follow, my soldiers are exhausted by long days of marching, the enemy is at once ahead of me, lying in ambush behind me, encamped to my left, holding another defensive position to my right, and blocking my narrow way forward with strong horses and fast chariots. What am I to do?몯

Sun Tzu replied: 몮First, move your light chariots ten li ahead of your army and order them to await the enemy there, and engage the enemy in battle in a place of dangerous and obstructive terrain. At the rear, spread out your soldiers and move now to the left, now to the right; the general must keep watch in all directions and identify a weakness in the enemy position, following which all parts of the army must converge in a suitable location. Once your soldiers become exhausted, then stop.몯

Once your men are exhausted, stop attacking, secure your position and re-gather your army. This is important, because moving over difficult ground is a painstaking task and it consumes a lot of energy. It몭s necessary to conserve your men몭s strength.


How to wage war in the 몬Nine terrain types몭 (part five): To break out of an encirclement, rely on cunning

Extract from the original text:
몮Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed-in ground. (멞 on-hemmed in ground, resort to stratagem.)몯

Analysis:
8) Hemmed-in ground:

Here, we몭re talking about being 몬hemmed in,몭 or surrounded, not by enemy forces but by terrain 멪 narrow roadways and places where the only way back is to travel long, twisting routes. If you get stuck in this kind of terrain, the enemy can beat you even with a small number of troops. This is what we mean when we talk about 몬hemmed-in ground.몭

Li Quan comments: 몮Here it is difficult to move.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮It is difficult both to enter such places and to exit them.몯

It몭s not just that these places are hard to get into; once you몭re in you can몭t get out, nor can you spread out your forces to fight.

So, what are you supposed to do? Sun Tzu몭s advice is this: 몮On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem.몯 In other words, you have to work it out yourself!

Clearly, there really isn몭t much you can do. Unless you come up with some clever plan, you몭ll never be able to get out.

The King of Wu once asked Sun Tzu: 몮Suppose I have entered into hemmed-in ground; before me the enemy awaits in strength and behind me I am backed against dangerous terrain; the enemy has severed my grain supply routes, is enticing me to retreat, and is sounding war drums, yet without advancing, to watch what my response will be. What should I do?몯

Sun Tzu replied: 몮This is what should be done in hemmed-in ground: you must obstruct access to your location and make it seem as though you plan to stay there; then you ought to treat your army like your family, and make the hearts of your men of one accord. Then, cook food enough for several days; in the following days, the enemy will believe we are weak and in tumult, because they will see no smoke where are cooking fires should be. Believing this, the enemy is sure to slacken their preparedness; then, fan the flames of your soldier몭s passions, rouse their fury, send forward a unit of your strongest men, and making use of the treacherous terrain to left and right, charge at the enemy to the beat of war drums. If the enemy tries to stop you, attack with rapid fury and you will be sure to break through the encirclement. Then, while your forward troops give battle, their gains shall be expanded upon by your rear troops, with left and right units working in unison, pinching the enemy between them.몯

First, make sure the enemy can몭t attack your position, and make it look like you have no intention of trying to smash your way out. Show everyone, your enemy and your own men, that you몭re determined and that you won몭t back down. This will make your troops 몬feel at home,몭 as it were. It will encourage them to think of the army as their family, and to think with one mind. Then, you can guard against the enemy with peace of mind. Cook all the food you몭ll need for several days in one go, and then don몭t cook for the next few days 멪 this will make the enemy think you have nothing to eat.

Make it look like you몭re in bad shape. As a reference point, look at this passage from Chapter Nine, in The Army on the March: 몮When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst멞 If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary. The sight of men whispering earnestly without ceasing or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file멞몯 You can act out all of these  diversionary tactics and put on a nice show for the enemy scouts.

The enemy will believe you몭re on your last legs, and that the fruits of victory will soon be theirs. They몭ll relax and let down their guard. This is the moment for you to call your whole army before you and prepare them to fight a decisive battle. Whip them up into a state of excitement and fury, and send out your best soldiers to charge the enemy in a sudden burst, all the while making use of the tricky terrain. If the enemy puts up a fight, move in hard and attack 멪 they won몭t be able to stop you from breaking through. While your vanguard fights at the front lines, your rear units will capitalize on the vanguard몭s gains. With your entire army mobilized and working in close coordination, you can quickly take down the enemy.

The King of Wu had another question for Sun Tzu: 몮If I have hemmed in my enemy and he conceals himself so as to plot and scheme; if he entices me and orders his flag bearers to wave them here and there in imitation of chaos, such that it is impossible to know in which direction he will move, what should I do?몯

This is just the opposite of the first situation the king asked about.

Sun Tzu said: 몮Send forth a thousand men waving flags. Meanwhile, block off the main transport route using a separate detachment of soldiers, and send a mobile unit towards the enemy to provoke him. Reserve the bulk of your army and maintain formation; do not engage them in fighting and keep them steady. Do not retreat. This is the way to thwart the enemy몭s plans.몯

Keep your main force in position and steady. Don몭t charge after the enemy, and don몭t retreat. Keep doing this, and watch what the enemy is trying to do; then you can work out what his plan is.


Staying alive in 몬desperate ground몭 멨 Nine times in ten, you몭re dead

What you need to learn is how to stay away from 몬desperate ground.몭 Once you몭re in such a place, you can몭t chase after life; you have to chase after certain death. But, you might be able to stay alive if you go just far enough into the jaws of death, and manage to find a few sacrificial lambs to offer up to annihilation.
High stakes risk-taking is not something to draw lessons from. If you몭re forced into it, you몭ll find out how strong your life force really is. That몭s all. 

Extract from the original text:
몮Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground. (멞 on desperate ground, fight.)몯

Analysis:
9) Desperate ground:

What몭s the difference between 몬difficult ground몭 and 몬desperate ground?몭 On 몬difficult ground,몭 you can wait, but there몭s no waiting on 몬desperate ground.몭 So, what can you do? 몮On desperate ground, fight.몯 Fight immediately, because if you fight quickly you may live, but if you몭re not quick you몭re going to die.몯

This is a vitally important point to make because, in most situations, waiting is in fact a viable option. But, if the leader thinks  they can몭t wait, and that fighting at speed might save them 멪 and not doing so will lead to death 멪 they end up walking into their own death for no good reason.

In[bd39][TT40] reality, it몭s not guaranteed that fighting quickly when you몭re on desperate ground is a foolproof way to survive. If it was, it wouldn몭t be called 몬desperate ground몭 in the first place; it몭d be called 몬be-quick-and-you몭ll-live ground.몭 In 몬desperate ground몭 the outcome is practically guaranteed to be death. There몭s no hope of survival. That몭s why you shouldn몭t chase after life. However, you might be able to stay alive if you go just far enough into death, and if you manage to find a few sacrificial lambs to offer up their lives! In other words, it몭s time to fight as though you몭re already dead. When an army does this, they become possessed of a power terrible to behold.
And what do our commentators have to say about 몬desperate ground?몭

Cao Cao comments: 몮High mountains ahead, great bodies of water behind; the road ahead is fruitless, the road behind is obstructed.몯

Li Quan comments: 몮Blocked by mountains, backing onto water, food has run out. In this situation, speed is beneficial, slowness is not.몯

Duke Li of Wei offers a more complete commentary: 몮Perhaps one has advanced with one몭s forces and, lacking a guide, plunges into danger and defeat and becomes constrained by the enemy. With a chasm to the left and cliffs to the right, one travels a road where horses must be led by hand and cart wheels hang into the void on one side; the way is blocked ahead and behind, rocks and cliffs over which one passes like a column of wild geese or fish on a line. One몭s battle lines are disorganized; if the enemy comes at speed and in strength, there is no solid ground for one to advance or retreat upon. One cannot fight even if one desires to, and there is no safety in guarding one몭s position. The days will be long if one stays still, and if one moves, then the enemy will be waiting in any direction one may choose. In this wilderness there is no drinking water or grass, the army lacks grain and supplies, the horses are weary and the men exhausted, one몭s resourcefulness is depleted and one몭s strength has reached its limits. When one man guards a narrow defile, ten thousand men cannot pass through. If the enemy has occupied such a location, then he possesses so great an advantage that one has already lost. Though one may have talented soldiers and sharp weapons, how can they be put to use? In 몬desperate ground몭 such as this, one may survive by fighting quickly; if one fails to fight quickly, death awaits. One must unify the hearts and minds of the various ranks within one몭s army so that they become a single force, pull out one몭s intestines and splash one몭s blood, charge forward toward death, glory in defeat, and transform disaster into a great good fortune.몯

Duke Li몭s discourse on 몬desperate ground몭 can be divided into commentaries about seven distinct situations:

1) 몮Perhaps one has advanced with one몭s forces and, lacking a guide, plunges into danger and defeat and becomes constrained by the enemy.몯

You didn몭t bother finding a local person to guide you as you moved your army forward. You plunged blindly ahead, got lost, and found yourself in a deep hole, in danger and at the mercy of the enemy. 
 
So, the main point to learn when studying 몬desperate ground몭 isn몭t how to fight in this kind of terrain, but how to avoid being forced into such a desperate situation in the first place. The first point Duke Li makes is the vital importance of studying the maps and being totally clear about the lay of the land. Also, you absolutely must use a guide while on the march, because this is the only way to avoid trapping yourself in 몬desperate ground.몭 Throughout Chinese history, renowned generals have always memorized maps inside out, and made a point of studying maps whenever they had a spare moment. When Liu Bang came through the mountain pass as a conqueror into the land of Qin, he didn몭t steal the beautiful women or the riches of Qin. Instead, his strategist Xiao He headed straight for the Qin archive library and gathered up all the maps he found there. The People몭s Liberation Army commanders Lin Biao and Su Yu used to sit in daylong trances before tables-full of maps, whether or not they were at war at the time. In their minds, great armies were constantly maneuvering back and forth across those maps.

2) 몮With a chasm to the left and cliffs to the right, one travels a road where horses must be led by hand and cart wheels hang into the void on one side.몯

The enemy doesn몭t even need to attack at this point. All they have to do is crowd you, and your whole army will plunge into the void.

3) 몮The way is blocked ahead and behind, rocks and cliffs over which one passes like a column of wild geese or fish on a line.몯

There몭s no road open to you either ahead or behind. All you can do is move single-file along the edge of steep cliffs.

4) 몮One몭s battle lines are disorganized; if the enemy comes at speed and in strength, there is no solid ground for one to advance or retreat upon.몯

You몭ve only just arrived at the battlefield, you haven몭t had a chance to organize your battle lines, you haven몭t built any defensive structures, you haven몭t had time to form up your soldiers, and already the enemy is charging towards you. If you advance to meet them, your army will be uncoordinated and unable to muster any kind of striking force; if you retreat, there몭s nowhere for you to shelter, and your army will disintegrate.

What to do in this situation? This has already been covered in an earlier section of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: victory belongs to whoever arrives first. The key is to be there waiting for the enemy. In this situation, your enemy is well prepared, while you몭ve showed up in total disarray and are completely unable to organize yourself. So, the battle is basically lost already, and there몭s nothing you can do except get ready for a messy scrap 멪 find out what your men are made of, and see whether their training has equipped them to fight, kill, and somehow carve out the slenderest hope of survival from the chaos.

If you get out alive, remember the next time to get to the battlefield first and be properly prepared. If the enemy gets there before you, don몭t go. Set up camp 30-50 li away, form up your battle lines and coax the enemy to you. Then, the enemy will be the one whose 몬battle lines are disorganized,몭 and they몭ll have 몬no solid ground for one to advance or retreat upon if the enemy comes at speed and in strength.몭 This is exactly how General Zhao She defeated the Qin army: he set up a defensive position 50 li away from the enemy camp and lured the enemy to him, compelling them to march the extra 50 li and tire themselves out.

5) 몮One cannot fight even if one desires to, and there is no safety in guarding one몭s position. The days will be long if one stays still, and if one moves then the enemy will be waiting in any direction one may choose.몯

Even if you try to make a fight happen, you won몭t be able to reach the enemy. And, if you try to stay put and defend, you몭ll find no terrain features to secure your position. If you hunker down, the days will drag past slowly and your situation won몭t get any better. If you try to take action, you몭ll be hemmed in by the enemy in both directions, and you몭ll be completely unable to move.

6) 몮In this wilderness there is no drinking water or grass, the army lacks grain and supplies, the horses are weary and the men exhausted, one몭s resourcefulness is depleted and one몭s strength has reached its limits.몯

Suppose you몭re in the Gobi Desert, and there몭s no water for your men and no grass for your horses. Your army has no food and everyone몭s exhausted, men and horses both. Your men몭s strength is being pushed to its limits, there몭s no way out, and no actionable plan.

7) 몮When one man guards a narrow defile, ten thousand men cannot pass through. If the enemy has occupied such a location, then he possesses so great an advantage that one has already lost. Though one may have talented soldiers and sharp weapons, how can they be put to use?몯

If your enemy holds a position where one man could hold off 10,000, the rope is already around your neck. No matter how strong your men are or how sharp your weapons, you won몭t be able to put them to use.

In any of these seven situations, if you attack quickly, survival is a possibility. If you don몭t, you몭ll die. You need to make everyone in your army, officers and rank-and-file soldiers alike, into a single mind. They need to be ready and willing to spill their own blood and march to their death; they need to find glory in their predicament and find something good in a hopeless situation.

The King of Wu once asked Sun Tzu: 몮Suppose my army has departed the borders of my country and travelled into enemy lands. The enemy has arrived in force and encircled me in many rings around. I wish to break through the encirclement, but I face an impregnable barrier in all directions. I desire to encourage my soldiers and rouse their spirits so that they are willing to forfeit their lives and break the enemy encirclement. How can I do this?몯

Sun Tzu replied: 몮Dig deep trenches and build high walls, creating the impression that you intend to take a defensive bearing. Remain calmly in place and do not move, thus concealing your capabilities. Inform your soldiers that the situation is desperate, that there is but one option before you. Slaughter your oxen and burn your carts, so as to provide a feast for your men. Burn your grain, fill in your wells, level your cooking ranges, cut your hair and cast aside your hats, thus severing yourself from care about whether you live. The men will see that their general has no other plan, and so they will steel themselves to death. Then, don armor and take up your swords and mould your army into a single force. Attack both of the enemy flanks amid the clamor and thunder of war drums; the enemy will be scared and will not know what they should do. Divide your best soldiers among the ranks and launch a fierce attack to the enemy몭s rear. This is how to abandon morality and seek life. Thus, it is said, 몬He who is in a desperate plight and yet does not make a plan is lost; he who is lost and yet does not fight is dead.몭몯

There are many rituals described here, all designed to unleash your men몭s inner fury and savagery. Once you몭ve whipped your men up and mentally prepared them for certain death, then is the time to charge the enemy.

If you find yourself in 몬desperate ground,몭 you몭re going to die nine times out of ten. When the odds of survival are so low, there몭s nothing to be learned from this situation. What you need to learn is how to stay away from 몬desperate ground.몭 Once you몭re in 몬desperate ground,몭 you can몭t chase after life; you have to chase after certain death. But, you might be able to stay alive if you go just far enough into death몭s door and if you manage to find a few sacrificial lambs to offer up. In the South Korean film, The Battle of Myeongyang, the Korean troops and officers were terrified by the power of the invading Japanese army, and one after another they came before the commander-in-chief, Yi Sun-sin, and asked him what they were going to do. Li Sun-sin몭s reply was brief: 몮Are you telling me you still want to live? Tomorrow we shall all go to our deaths!몯 Surviving when you몭re in desperate ground isn몭t about learning how to survive; it몭s about learning how to accept death!
High stakes risk-taking is not something to draw lessons from 멪 if you몭re forced into it, you몭ll find out how strong your life force really is. That몭s all. Don몭t, whatever you do, try to copy what Han Xin did, leading his men to the edge of a river and forming up for battle with their backs to the deep water. As you몭ll recall, that was only part of the story; he also had 2,000 men waiting behind, ready to help out. He was never really in 몬desperate ground,몭 he only made it look like he was. It was a fake. If those 10,000 men backed up against the river really had been his whole army 멪 if he had no other forces to call upon, and yet those 10,000 somehow managed to survive 멪 only then could you say that he had gone into desperate ground and come out on the other side alive!
People are fond of exaggerating and adding flavor to details. That몭s what gives stories their dramatic tension, and everyone likes a bit of drama, including those who write the official histories, which also contain a good amount of seasoning. But facts are as cold as ice. So, when we read history, we mustn몭t fall into the traps that our innate fondness for drama sets out for us; we must not think that you can reenact the battles we read about, move for move. You몭ll find that if you try this, the script that reality plays from isn몭t what you imagined.
This is the real script: everyone who goes into 몬desperate ground몭 dies. That몭s why it몭s called 몬desperate ground.몭

The King of Wu asked Sun Tzu: 몮If I have surrounded the enemy, what should I do?몯
Sun Tzu replied: 몮Where the cliffs are steep and the ravine is perilous, such that the terrain is impassible, then it may be said that the enemy is cornered. This is how to strike: conceal soldiers in ambush, open a way for the enemy to exit his confinement; show him a way out. As he flees for his life, he will have no appetite for battle, and thus you can attack. Even if his soldiers are numerous, your victory is certain.몯
According to The Art of War: 몮If the enemy is in desperate ground, his soldiers will be filled with courage. The way to attack such an enemy is to use smoothness, and not to pit strength against strength. You may gain advantage by secretly establishing a secure position. Then, you must open a path for the enemy while blocking the road in various places with elite cavalry soldiers in various positions. Send fast soldiers to draw him out, form up as if to fight, but do not engage. This is the way to scheme the enemy몭s defeat.몯
Don몭t keep the enemy totally surrounded. It몭s necessary to give him an escape route; you have to make him run. If the enemy몭s men think they might live, they won몭t want to die and their will to fight will weaken. Their minds will be filled with thoughts of escaping death. Set up ambushes along the road, manned by your best troops, and each time the enemy triggers an ambush, you can eat away at his forces. Then, chase down the remainder. This is not only a way to guarantee total victory, it also guarantees that your army won몭t suffer any losses.
Suppose you have surrounded 1,000 enemy soldiers. If you keep up a watertight encirclement, you can be sure of killing every single enemy soldier, but at a cost of perhaps 800 of your own men, because the enemy will be fighting like cornered animals. But, if you give them an escape route and stage your attacks at various points along the road, although 20 enemy soldiers might get away, you can limit your own casualties to ten soldiers or less.


The artistry of commanding an army as battle breaks Out 멨 First and foremost, harass the enemy

Extract from the original text:
몮Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy몭s front and rear; to prevent cooperation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men. When the enemy troops were scattered, they prevented them from assembling, and when the enemy몭s men were pressed together, they prevented them from uniting. When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.몯

Analysis:
The most effective battle commanders of ancient China all kept these skills in their arsenal. They knew how to 몮Drive a wedge between the enemy몭s front and rear멞몯
The best generals had the ability to separate the front and rear parts of the enemy army and stop them from helping each other or coordinating.
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Establish an ambush, then charge and slaughter.몯 Set up an auxiliary force in an ambush position and use them to charge the enemy, scattering their troops and breaking up the links between different parts of their army.

몮Prevent cooperation between his large and small divisions멞몯
Prevent the enemy몭s main force and their smaller forces from backing each other up. Mei Yaochen comments: 몮This is about harassing the enemy.몯

몮Hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men.몯
This is about stopping the enemy몭s officers and rank-and-file from helping each other; it몭s a way of sowing confusion in the ranks, spreading panic and breaking down the enemy몭s organizational structures.

몮When the enemy troops were scattered, they prevented them from assembling, and when the enemy몭s men were pressed together, they prevented them from uniting.몯

Keep the enemy soldiers scattered. If they are already gathered together, make it impossible for them to form up in an orderly formation.

Du Mu comments: 몮Employ varied and numerous deceits to harass the enemy; you may charge his front lines and slaughter his rear units, or launch a surprise attack in the east before striking from the west, or array your soldiers in a false formation, or unveil an irregular formation. If I join battle with my soldiers in shapeless formation, the enemy must make preparations to counter all possibilities, and so the great host of his army becomes divided. I fill his thoughts with fear and disperse his forces; his officers and soldiers are panicked and harassed so that they are unable to unite in an orderly fashion. This is the way skillful generals conduct battles.몯
An army is only an army if it몭s organized. Without organizational structures, even if you have a million men, your army might as well be a massive flock of lambs awaiting slaughter. The artistry of directing the flow of a battle is all about disrupting the enemy몭s organization. Any time in history when a small army has defeated a large one, it몭s always been because the leaders of the larger army either lacked the ability to organize their men, or their chain of command broke down.

몮When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still.몯

If you can manufacture a situation that favors your army, take action; if you can몭t, don몭t move.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Use violence to scatter them, use chaos to make them unable to organize themselves, then mobilize and engage.몯
Li Quan comments: 몮Harass them until an opportunity becomes apparent, then take action. If they do not move, then be still.몯

몮If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.몯

The first item on the agenda when you몭re trying to control the course of a battle is to harass and disrupt the enemy. But, if they keep their shape, and if they have more soldiers than you and begin advancing toward you in neat formation, what should you do?
Seize something the enemy holds dear. Cao Cao comments: 몮First, seize an advantage upon which he relies. If I arrive first upon favourable ground and occupy it, then I am sure to gain what I desire.몯

Cao Cao is saying that 몬what the enemy holds dear몭 is the favourable conditions he몭s counting on to win. If you hold the best ground, you몭ve seized the initiative.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮That which the enemy holds dear is territory and food; if I seize these things first, then circumstances will in no way proceed counter to my plans.몯
If you hold the territory and the food supplies, the enemy will dissolve in panic and chaos; they몭ll be completely unable to muster the courage and energy to take the fight to you.
In the case of Li Shimin defeating Dou Jiande, which we learned about earlier, 3,500 men under Li Shimin took possession of Hulao Pass and successfully kept out Dou Jiande몭s 100,000-strong army. Then, Li found a way to wipe out Dou Jiande몭s grain supply units and steal all his food. Once that had happened, it was only natural that Dou Jiande lost.


It takes years to raise an army, but only a moment to use it

Extract from the original text:
몮Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy몭s unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots. The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you. Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food. Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their utmost strength. Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard. Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the alert; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted. Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared. If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity. On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Gui.몯

Analysis:
몮The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.몯

Having penetrated into enemy territory, you are already deep in 몬serious ground.몭 At this point, your soldiers won몭t even think about running away. Their minds will be focused, and they will fight with everything they have.
The reason why the enemy can몭t beat you is that while you몭re in 몬serious ground,몭 and the enemy is in 몬dispersive ground.몭 As we몭ve already said, dispersive ground is no place to fight. So, the enemy몭s will to fight won몭t be as strong as yours.
Du Mu comments: 몮This passage comments on the art of attacking in general. If you have entered deep within enemy lands, your soldiers will have the conviction to die and their minds will be focused. The defending enemy will be unable to defeat you.몯

몮Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.몯

This aligns with passages from earlier in the text: 몮On serious ground, gather in plunder멞 procure your food from the enemy.몯 If you do this, all your men and horses will stay well fed.

몮Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.몯

Make sure to keep your soldiers well rested and fit. Keep their energy sharp and their strength focused. Use deception and schemes whenever you move your army, so that the enemy can몭t work out what you몭re doing.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Nurture your soldiers and keep your army몭s energy unified. When you move your army, plan it in such a way as to be inscrutable to the enemy.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮This is about what to do when one plunges deep into enemy territory. One must plunder the countryside to keep one몭s army sufficiently supplied with food. Then, enclose oneself behind walls and nurture one몭s army. Do not exhaust them with labor, but maintain their full strength and energy so that one may obtain victory immediately upon taking action. When one moves, use variety so that the enemy is unable to take one몭s measure.몯
When Wang Jian destroyed the state of Chu, he did it by using this exact approach.
He set out with 600,000 Qin soldiers on a mission to annihilate Chu. When he arrived, he set up camp, built fortifications and dug moats, and then concentrated on looking after his men and keeping them sharp. Day after day, all he did was organize athletic competitions, getting his troops to compete at games such as rock throwing. When the Chu forces tried to provoke Wang into fighting, he just stayed secure behind his defenses and refused to come out. The massive size of the Qin army scared the Chu leaders out of trying to attack them in their camp. Time went by, and eventually a year passed without any change in the situation. The Chu soldiers were tired and stiff after a year of waiting and being constantly on alert. So, they began to roam the area to get some exercise, and as soon as they moved from their position, Wang Jian pounced, ending the war in a single, bloody battle. Afterwards, the state of Chu ceased to exist.

몮Nurture your soldiers and keep your army몭s energy unified.몯 There몭s actually a huge amount of information contained in this brief line of commentary by Cao Cao. When people look at wars, they always concentrate on the actual fighting. And yet, the fighting is only one part of war, and as we몭ve said again ad again, it몭s not the most important part. Sun Tzu said: 몮Win first, fight later.몯 By the time fighting starts, it몭s only happening because victory has already been sealed. It몭s a case of 몬beating them and then fighting,몭 not 몬beating them by fighting them.몭 The secret of warfare lies in what conditions you need to meet, and what conditions you need to identify in the enemy, that give you the signal to launch your attack.
When Zeng Guofan was in charge of the Hunan army, he didn몭t have many clever stratagems or tricks. What he did have was a steady, grounded attitude. This gave him staying power. He always consolidated his advantages. In his diary, the things he paid attention to during drawn-out stays in camp while besieging enemy towns were details like whether there was enough meat and whether there were any vegetables. Eventually, he decreed that every time his army set up a new camp, they must plant crops and breed pigs. This way, he몭d have fresh vegetables and meat; he몭d be living right, and his men would have some physical work to keep them fit and their energy sharp.
There몭s a saying: 몬It takes years to raise an army, but only a moment to use it.몭 Normally, this phrase is used to remind soldiers that the state is looking after them, so when the time comes to take to the battlefield, they몭d better repay their debt to the motherland. But, this isn몭t what the phrase originally meant. It comes from the ancient text, The History of the Southern Dynasties, in a chapter entitled, A Biography of Chen Xuan: 몮One may keep an army for a thousand days without using it, but one may not keep an army for a single day without being properly prepared.몯
There are three layers of meaning in these words. First, it몭s possible to keep an army for years. If you carefully look after your men and don몭t work them too hard, you can build up their strength and mould their energy into a single force, and you can maintain it without ever using it. But, the moment you do use it, it evaporates.
Second, you use an army for only a very short period of time. So, it몭s important to wait until the crucial moment, when the enemy is unprepared, caught off-guard, and not expecting you. Then, fling your army from your hand and strike like lightning; only if you do this can you guarantee victory. It몭s like when two people are in a knife fight 멪 before you lunge, while the knife is in your hand and ready for use, you still have all your energy at your disposal. If you lunge, but your knife doesn몭t find your opponent몭s body, in the moment before you pull your knife back you몭ve left the door wide open for your opponent. You have no energy to call upon and you몭re in a state of almost total defenselessness. If your opponent seizes his chance, you몭re finished.
The power of a knife comes from the moment before you lunge with it. If you do lunge, it몭s imperative that you get a result. If you don몭t, your enemy will, and in all likelihood you몭ll be dead.
The third layer of meaning has already been discussed in the previous section: you have to be constantly ready to defend. You can몭t let your guard down for a single second. If you do, the enemy will serve you up on a plate.

몮Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight.몯

If you bring your men into a place where there몭s no way out, they몭ll naturally be mentally prepared to die in battle, and they won몭t run away. After all, there몭s nowhere to run anyway.

몮If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their utmost strength.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮The soldiers being willing to die, how could they fail to be victorious?몯

몮Officers and men alike will put forth their utmost strength.몯 

Facing death, they don몭t have any choice but to fight with all their strength. Cao Cao comments: 몮In challenging terrain, their hearts are united.몯 It몭s critically important for your men to pool their strength and make their thinking as one.
There몭s a passage in the Wei Liaozi that reads: 몮When a single brigand takes up a sword and takes to hacking all around him in a market, though there are ten thousand people there, every one of them will shrink away from him, and not a single one will have the courage to fight him alone, because all ten thousand people are unworthy. One who has committed himself to death can never be compared to one who has committed himself to life.몯
The man with the sword is ready to die, but everyone else wants to live. He is a true terrorist, in the sense that everyone else is terrified of him.

몮Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear.몯

When people find themselves in desperate peril, they accept that death is inevitable, and so they no longer fear the enemy. They are already dead, so what is there to be scared of? There몭s nothing scarier than death, is there?

몮If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮They are bound and trussed.몯 They몭re trapped. There몭s a Chinese saying: 몬Grasshoppers tied together on a length of string.몭 When an army comes to a dead end deep in enemy territory, it몭s as if they몭re bound together with rope 멪 they must fight like cornered animals, and they must fight as a single unit.
Du Mu comments: 몮If there is no help, then the men will all suspect that they have already entered the land of death and that survival is impossible. They will resolve to fight death with death. There being utterly no help available, each and every man will fight with all their strength.몯
몬Fight death with death몭 멪 these four words are crucial. It몭s not about fighting desperately against death in the hope of living. The moment the idea of survival occurs, it becomes much more difficult to fight against death, because you might surrender or try to run away. But, if survival isn몭t even a possibility in your mind, your mindset will be: 몬I might as well take some enemy soldiers with me, since I몭m going to die anyway.몭 This is the only way to truly keep the possibility of survival alive.

몮Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the alert; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted.몯

When you have an army like this, you don몭t need to keep them in line or order them around. The men will know without you telling them to stay vigilant. Without the officers making any demands of them, they몭ll be able to fight with all their strength. Without any boundaries being set or any encouragement given, they몭ll be so intimate with each other that they몭ll form the most united of fronts. When you have an army like this, you won몭t need to repeat your orders again and again, because they몭ll keep their discipline anyway.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Everyone is crammed together on the same boat.몯
This passage forms the root of a saying that has entered the Chinese language as a 몬four-character idiom몭 멪 몬Wu and Yue on the same boat.몭 During the Spring and Autumn period, the states of Wu and Yue were bitter rivals; they had been fighting for generations. One day, a group of common folk from both countries were crossing a river on the same boat. They sat there, shooting hostile looks at each other, when suddenly the weather turned bad just as the boat reached the middle of the river. Strong wind and heavy rain sprang up from nowhere, and it seemed as though the boat was about to capsize. The only thing to do was to climb the mast and unfurl the sails. Suddenly, everyone on the boat, Wu and Yue alike, moved as quickly as they could. Working together, they managed to unfurl the sail, and the day was saved. 
On stormy waters, everyone몭s in the same boat; enemies can turn into family. You don몭t need to preach the message that 몬unity is strength,몭 because circumstances force people to put it into action.

몮Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.몯

Forbid all superstitious activities and clear up your men몭s deluded doubts. Do this, and they will fight to the death and never run away.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Forbidding all talk of omens and sorcery is the stratagem for dispelling doubt.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮Lord Huang Shi said: 몬Forbid fortune-telling and wish-making in order that your officers and soldiers do not divine the fortunes, good or ill, of your army. Fear disturbs the mentality of soldiers.몭 Lord Huang meant that if one dispels doubt, then one몭s soldiers will fight unto death without being distracted by other thoughts.몯 
Of course, there are examples in which the opposite happened 멪 when generals cast themselves in the role of gods or wizards and prophesied that the army would enjoy great good fortune, all in an effort to spur on their men to fight bravely. That몭s exactly what General Tian Dan did while defending the city of Jimo. He had one of his men dress up as an immortal and then brought him out and treated him like a deity, with all the respect and ceremony that몭s proper when dealing with divine beings. He waited hand and foot upon the man, and every time he gave an order, he would always say that it was the will of the immortal.

몮If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity.몯

The reason 몬our soldiers are not overburdened with money몭 is because they have to choose between money and their lives. They don몭t fear death, either, but that몭s not because they don몭t want to live to 몬a good old age.몭 Rather, it몭s because if they don몭t fight without fear of dying, they have no chance of surviving the war.
Cao Cao comments: 몮If they all burn their riches, it is not that they loathe being overburdened with them; they abandon their riches and draw close to death because there is no other choice.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮If they have wealth, then sadly the soldiers will feel attached to it and the idea will occur to them that they ought to cling to life. They might not have the conviction to meet with death.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Wealth and long life are things that people hold dear. So, when people burn and discard riches and cut themselves free from the prospect of long life, it is not because these things are loathsome to them, but that they have no choice.몯

몮On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Zhu or a Gui.몯

In war, it몭s generally true that when you give marching orders, there are men who will weep. But, if you put them in a place where there몭s nowhere to go except forward, each and every one of them will become as brave as the legendary heroes Zhu Zhuan and Cao Gui.
Just how brave was Zhu Zhuan? When Duke Guang of Wu (who later became King Helu of Wu) ordered him to assassinate King Liao of Wu, he accepted the mission. Duke Guang invited King Liao to his house to eat with him. Zhu Zhuan brought dishes to the table, among which was a whole cooked fish with a dagger concealed in its belly. When Zhu Zhuan pulled out the dagger and leapt toward King Liao, he was immediately impaled from behind by a spear wielded by the king몭s bodyguard. And yet, with his last breath he managed to stab the king, and the blow was fatal.
What about Cao Gui? What made him brave? He was a senior official in the state of Lu, and in a previous chapter we discussed his role in the Battle of Changshao. It was he who came up with 몬The strategy of three rounds of drumming.몭 Recall that the first round of drumming builds up soldiers몭 energy; in the second round, the enemy몭s energy begins to deflate; and in the third round, the enemy soldiers enter a state of rest. He was there with Duke Zhuang of Lu during his conference with Duke Huan of Qi at Dong몭e, and it was he who pulled out a dagger and seized Duke Huan, putting him in a position to secure an alliance treaty that restored Lu몭s lost lands.


If you tie everyone to a war chariot, nobody can get off

Extract from the original text:
몮The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuairan. Now, the shuairan is a snake that is found in the Chang Mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuairan, I should answer, 몬Yes.몭 For the men of Wu and the men of Yue are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other몭s assistance just as the left hand helps the right. Hence it is not enough to put one몭s trust in the squaring of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground. The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach. How to make the best of both strong and weak? That is a question involving the proper use of ground. Thus, the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, whether he likes it or not, by the hand.몯

Analysis:
몮Hence it is not enough to put one몭s trust in the squaring of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.몯
몬Squaring of horses몭 means tethering them. Even if you tie up the horses and bury the chariot wheels in an attempt to stop your soldiers from running away, you can몭t trust them not to run anyway.
Cao Cao comments: 몮몬Squaring horses몭 means to tether them. Chariot wheels are buried to show your men that they are not to move. This passage tells that it is better to adapt intelligently than to rely exclusively on creating difficulties for the soldiers.몯 It is more effective to be flexible with your troops than to force them into anything. This way, you can create a situation where they have no choice but to fight to the death.
Why does 몬squaring몭 mean the same thing as 몬tethering?몭 Du Mu comments: 몮Horses are tethered in order to form battle lines that are even and square.몯 So, the horses aren몭t tethered to posts. Rather, they몭re tied up in their respective battle units 멪  forward, rear, left and right 멪  so they can몭t run away.

몮The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮Being unified and possessed of courage, the soldiers of an army become as one; this is a principle to be used by all in positions of governance.몯
Chen Hao comments: 몮The style of governance and orders both being strict and clear, brave soldiers will not advance alone, and neither will cowards retreat alone; all the soldiers of the army will be as one.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Positioning them in a place of peril and causing them to keep each other alive, the masses of soldiers within the army will pool their strength and unify their courage as though they were one man. This is the proper way to govern armies.몯

몮How to make the best of both strong and weak 멪 that is a question involving the proper use of ground.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮The strong and weak shall be of a single energy.몯 The key to unlocking the potential of strong and weak soldiers alike is to use the terrain appropriately and set your army up in the best possible position.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Gaining the advantage of favourable terrain, even weak soldiers can defeat the enemy in battle, let alone the strongest among your soldiers. It is the energy provided by terrain that enables one to make full and simultaneous use of both weak and strong soldiers.몯
Your army is made up of both strong and weak soldiers, and you need to make full use of all of them. A good example of this is how Li Shimin used 3,500 soldiers to defeat Dou Jiande몭s army of 100,000. How do you properly use 3,500 people? He kept 3,000 of them to guard Hulao Pass, a transport corridor so narrow that a single man could guard it against 10,000. There was no way the enemy would be able to fight their way in. Meanwhile, Li Shimin led the remaining 500 men out of the pass to pick a fight, luring Cheng Yaojin and Qin Shubao to chase after him with their troops, while he set an ambush at the side of the road. Later in that conflict, Li Shimin selected the six strongest men from the 500, who themselves were the strongest of his entire 3,500-strong force. They included two ubermensch warriors 멪  Yuchi Jingde and himself 멪 and went out again to pick another fight. Li Shimin said to Yuchi Jingde: 몮With my bow, and your spear, not even a thousand armed men could touch us!몯 The two of them, along with their four handpicked cavalrymen, headed straight for Dou Jiande몭s main camp and lured several thousand enemy troops into the pre-assigned ambush location, where Li몭s forces won a great victory. Winning the first couple rounds of this conflict provided a huge morale boost to the 3,000 soldiers left guarding Hulao Pass. This is how to use both the strong and weak soldiers in your army.

몮Thus, the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, whether he likes it or not, by the hand.몯

So, the best strategists have the ability to make their army work as a single unit, almost as a single body, because they are able to engineer circumstances in which their men have no choice but to go along with him. If each and every one of their men has no way out and no other choice but to do what they say, the commander has effectively tied them to his war chariot.
Li Quan comments: 몮The patterns by which to govern a great multitude are the same as those used to govern a small number of men.몯 This is the same principle that we몭ve already seen in a passage from Chapter Five, Energy: 몮The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men멞 Fighting with a large army under your command is no different from fighting with a small one.몯 People who have a firm grasp on the art of managing an army are just as unconstrained and at ease commanding any number of men as if they were only in charge of a single man. They are able to advance and withdraw as one and unify their men몭s bodies and minds.


As a leader, don몭t be frantically busy, be calm and collected; Your movements should be neither slow nor rushed

We think that becoming successful and catching hold of success always comes from motion 멪 몬We have to move, because by moving we take hold of success.몭 And yet, so often we flail and grab at success but come up empty-handed. Can we calm down, do some serious thinking and steadily build success? Can we let it come to us from a place of calmness, instead of spinning around in constant motion, grabbing at it? This is the thinking behind strategy, behind Buddhism, and behind managing military issues. It몭s also a kind of wisdom that can be applied to life in general.

Extract from the original text:
몮It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance. By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose. At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nobody knows whither he is going. To muster his host and bring it into danger: this may be termed the business of the general.몯

Analysis:
몮It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮This is what is called 몬quiet몭 멪 serene, obscure and orderly.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮몬Quiet몭 is a simple and easy thing; obscurity is difficult to gauge; orderliness does not err. By using these, one is able to govern with total effectiveness.몯
As a leader, you don몭t want to be manic or overly busy. It몭s best to stay calm and level-headed. Don몭t do things too slowly, but don몭t be too quick either. Take plenty of time to think things over, act in a systematic way, behave with moderation, and keep as a tight a grip on events as you can[bd41].
We want to control other people, and we make up many rules and demands that we place on them, but we don몭t consider that if we want to straighten out other people we first have to straighten out ourselves. Then, we have to use our own 몬straightness몭 as a mould, and reproduce it throughout the ranks of our army.
The Confucians have something to say about the idea that 몬to straighten out other people we first have to straighten out ourselves.몭 They put it like this: 몬Rectify your heart, make your thoughts honest, cultivate your moral self, bring order to your house, bring good governance to your country, and bring peace to the world.몭 The principle also applies to military leaders: cultivate your own moral fiber in order to bring order to your army.
In Zeng Guofan몭s approach to the art of military leadership, he put special emphasis on the concept of 몬incorruptibility.몭 Zeng said that ordinary soldiers don몭t understand the art of war, and they have no idea which generals are more talented than others. Yet, when it comes to gold and silver, they have a very clear idea of what몭s happening. If a general is greedy and corrupt, there몭s no way his soldiers will truly submit to him. But, if a general is clean and honest in matters of money, his soldiers will accept him as their leader. If, on top of that, the general has the ability to clearly lay out information about rewards and punishments, and also make sure all of his men get a share of whatever profit the army might come by, each and every one of his men will be ready and willing to fight alongside him.

몮He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.몯

This isn몭t about fooling people; it몭s about keeping secrets. You can몭t let your men know what your battle plans are. Just make sure everyone knows what their individual task is, while remaining in the dark about the planning and intent of the war effort. It is what must be done to protect military secrets.
Cao Cao comments: 몮It is permissible for the people to come together with you in joy, but not to start out from worry.몯 A leader몭s responsibility is to fill everyone with confidence and get them to work side by side; what a leader mustn몭t do is spread worry through his ranks about what on earth should be done. Confucius said something along the same lines: 몮The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it.몯 The soldiers should only know what their individual tasks are, while the general keeps a grip on the overall situation.

몮By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge.몯

By making frequent use of variation in the way you carry out operations, and by constantly tweaking your stratagems, other parties won몭t be able to decode what you몭re up to.
Du Mu comments: 몮In all that you do and in all that you plan, do not show the original thoughts that bring these things into being and do not make known the source from which they flow.몯 Make sure people know what you몭re doing, but not how. Then, nobody will be able to work out what your next step will be.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮All your former acts and all your old plans were varied and changed so that people could not know them.몯 If you몭re constantly bringing variety and change into what you do, nobody can know what you몭ll do next. This is because the people who make up your army aren몭t just your brothers-at-arms; your ranks will always contain a certain number of enemy spies and even your own people who, without knowing it, leak secrets. That몭s why you mustn몭t let anyone work out what your next move will be, and you have to make nonsense of any information that might enable people to identify a pattern.
On the other hand, if you몭re in a constant state of instability, how can you make sure your men listen to you? This calls for some more tricks. Zhang Yu wrote about the story of a famous Tang dynasty general named Pei Xingjian, who waited until just after his men had set up camp and then suddenly gave the order that the camp was to be moved up a nearby mountain. The men would have to break everything down and set up again. The soldiers weren몭t happy. In fact, they felt extremely frustrated. But, when evening came, a heavy rainstorm appeared from nowhere and flooded the original campsite, where the water rose over ten feet deep. The soldiers were shocked, and asked Pei Xingjian, 몮How did you know it was going to rain?몯 Pei replied: 몮In the future, when I tell you to do something, you do it. Don몭t ask me what I know, and don몭t ask me how I know.몯
Pei Xingjian managed the situation expertly. If he몭d told his men there was a possibility of rain, but then the rain failed to show up, they몭d stop believing everything he said. He didn몭t say anything, so if it hadn몭t rained that night, nobody would have made the connection between the weather and his command to move camp. And so, his authority wouldn몭t have been compromised. In fact, it did rain 멪 to an extent that everyone would have perished 멪 and he gained a reputation for supernatural foresight. This boosted his authority even higher.

몮By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.몯

If you want your men to keep a secret, the best approach is to keep them from knowing the secret in the first place. If you do that, the enemy can send as many spies as they want; it still won몭t do them any good.

몮At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him.몯

When a commander assigns tasks to his men, it몭s like he sends them up a ladder to the floor above, and then pulls the ladder away so they have no choice to retreat.


몮He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nobody knows whither he is going.몯

When a commander-in-chief leads his men deep into enemy territory, it몭s like firing an arrow 멪  once you몭re there, there몭s no coming back. He burns his boats and smashes his cooking pots, because today will be the day of the battle that seals the war. The commander drives his troops before him like a herd of sheep, turning this way and that, nobody knowing where they몭re going, only that they are to follow their leader.
Li Quan comments: 몮The general, having burned all the ships, hardens the resolve of his men, who neither know what their commander몭s plan may be, nor harbor any thought of returning home. In this way, they are like herded sheep.몯 The soldiers have no idea what their commander is thinking; all they can do is stake their lives on following him. In this respect, they몭re no different from a herd of cattle or a flock of sheep being driven by their herder.

몮To muster his host and bring it into danger 멪 this may be termed the business of the general.몯

It is a general몭s duty to lead his men into peril and somehow find a way to victory.
I몭m suddenly reminded of the America general George Patton몭s famous words at the height of World War II: 몮I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor, dumb bastard die for his country.몯
Although it몭s a generals몭 business to take his men into danger, it몭s also your responsibility to bring them home alive. As Zeng Guofan put it, the young men you lead to war should, after the war is won and they return home to their parents and brothers and sisters, remain simple and honest young men, if perhaps more mature than when they left. You mustn몭t lead them astray and teach them the vices of gluttony, drinking, whoring, gambling and smoking.
This is the way of the benevolent, Confucian general.


Success depends on making just a little bit of effort every day

Extract from the original text:
몮The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.몯

Analysis:
The ability to respond flexibly to each of the nine situations and to a developing situation, as well as mastery over the psychology and emotions of the many kinds of people in your army, are essential capabilities that every general should possess. This passage is a summary of the nine situations, and it also lays the ground for what comes next.
The reason there is special mention of 몬the fundamental laws of human nature,몭 or just 몬emotions,몭 is to highlight the role of managing energy. The only way to gain control over your army몭s morale is to master human psychology and emotions. If you can do that, you be able to both boost your men몭s morale and take control of the enemy몭s.
Confucian scholars talk about 몬the Laws of Heaven,몭 몬the Laws of the Realm,몭 and, as with the art of war, they also talk about 몬the laws of human nature.몭 We몭ve already seen examples of how the art of war is applied to human nature or emotions 멪 when we talk about managing energy, that basically means paying attention to your soldiers몭 psychological state. Psychology determines morale, and morale determines an army몭s fighting ability.
Zeng Guofan had two things to say about studying. First, stay committed and study every day, even if you only read one page or even one line in a day. Stay dedicated and you몭ll progress quickly enough 멪 this is the idea of moving at speed without hurrying. The worst scenario is to whip yourself into a frenzy and go all out for one, huge session, only to abandon your efforts as soon as you lose steam. If that몭s the way you do things, you몭ll have a hard time finishing anything.
The key to finishing a job and achieving a goal is to keep moving forward, one step every day. If the road to success were a chess game, becoming successful would depend on using pawns, not rooks, because you don몭t have as many rooks as pawns. And yet, lots of people only want to use their rooks. If you try to talk to them about pawns, they simply don몭t listen.
The second thing Zeng Guofan said about studying and reading is that you should finish reading the book in your hands before starting the next. That몭s so you don몭t end up with a hulking pile of books, all of which you gave up on halfway through.
I suppose this could be called 몬the art of war for reading books.몭



Once inside enemy territory, unite your army as one

Extract from the original text:
몮When invading hostile territory, the general principle is that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion. When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground. When you have the enemy몭s strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army. On contentious ground, I would hurry up the rear. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances. On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road. On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat. On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of keeping their lives.몯

Analysis:
몮When invading hostile territory, the general principle is that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion.몯
When fighting as a 몬visitor몭 in foreign lands, your soldiers몭 minds will become focused and their resolve will harden once you몭re deep in enemy territory. But, if you don몭t plunge deep into enemy territory, your men몭s fighting spirit will easily become diluted and weak.
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Entering deeply brings focus and solidity; entering shallowly brings dispersion and a desire to return home.몯 This is the difference between serious ground and facile ground on the one hand, which we몭ve already talked about, and shallow ground.

몮When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground. When you have the enemy몭s strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.몯


This passage introduces an additional piece: 몬critical ground.몭 Mei Yaochen comments: 몮This refers to a situation in which one cannot reach facile ground by moving forward, yet also cannot reach dispersive ground by retreating; critical ground is between these two other types of terrain.몯 When you몭re a short distance inside enemy territory, you are no longer in dispersive ground, but you also have not yet reached facile ground.
Areas with easy transportation links in all directions are 몬ground of intersecting highways,몭 areas deep within enemy territory are 몬serious ground,몭 and areas only a short distance inside enemy territory are 몬shallow ground.몭 Terrain characterized by impregnable, dangerous terrain behind and narrow, obstructed passages in front is 몬hemmed-in ground,몭 and areas where there is no way out is 몬desperate ground.몭
What몭s the right way to deal with each of these different terrain types?

몮Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose.몯

Li Quan comments: 몮Mind of a single soldier.몯 Bring together an army and make them of one mind and one will.
Du Mu comments: 몮When defending, the army몭s will is as one; when fighting a battle, it is easy to become dispersed.몯 When you몭re holding a defensive position behind a fortified wall, everyone in your army will be unified in their intent to prevent the enemy from breaking in. But, if you come out from behind the walls to fight, the idea will occur to some of your men that this is an opportunity to run away and go home. This is the logic behind the earlier passage: 몮On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not.몯 Hold your ground and don몭t go looking for a fight.

몮On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between all parts of my army.몯

When you enter facile ground, make sure the various campsites of the different units in your army are close to each other and connected. There are two reasons for this. First, it몭s a way to defend against enemy attack, because it makes it easier for different units to support and rescue each other. Second, it몭s a way to defend against your own men running away.


Ask yourself: 몬What have I learned?몭 멨 Don몭t get caught up in words and their meanings

When you study ancient treatises, or when you have an experience, ask yourself: 몬What have I learned?몯 Try to understand the writer몭s thinking, not the meaning of the words.

Analysis:
몮On contentious ground, I would hurry up the rear.몯
This line causes some problems. All of our commentators have a different interpretation.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Favourable ground lies ahead. One should order one몭s rear units to advance quickly.몯 This is effectively a non-comment, because he몭s saying exactly the same thing as Sun Tzu. Cao Cao understands, but the others don몭t. The issue is, what does 몬rear몭 mean? Does it mean you should maneuver your army behind the enemy?
Du Mu comments: 몮On terrain which is vital to the point that it must be contended over, if I am behind then I must rush forward to contend for it; is this any less true if I do not start from behind?몯
Chen Hao tells us that Du Mu몭s comment is incorrect. Chen Hao comments: 몮Both statements are incorrect. If the enemy occupies the favourable ground and I come from behind to contend for it, would this not be exhausting my army by coming to fight when the battleground is already held by the enemy? What is meant here about the vital importance of hurrying up the rear when on contentious ground is that if the favourable ground is in front, then one should first select one몭s best soldiers and send them to occupy it. Then, if the enemy comes to contend for it with the whole mass of his army, one should come with the main part of one몭s army and strike the enemy몭s rear; then it would be impossible not to overcome the enemy.몯
Chen Hao claims that the commentators who came before him were wrong, but his own logic doesn몭t stand up to scrutiny. In fact, Du Mu was saying that if the enemy has gotten ahead of you, you should chase after him, and try to get ahead, so you can be the first to arrive at the contentious ground. Du Mu was not saying that in this scenario the enemy has already occupied the contentious ground.
Chen Hao몭s comment argues that if the favourable terrain is ahead of you, you should send a small unit of elite soldiers to occupy it. Then, if the enemy attacks their position in force, you can send your main army to attack them from behind.
Chen Hao seems once again to have put too much of his own thinking into his comment. With contentious ground, if you get hold of it, it몭s yours, and that몭s all. Sun Tzu probably wasn몭t saying that after you몭ve taken the contentious ground you should come up behind the enemy and strike their rear.
Du You comments: 몮With favourable terrain ahead, one should enter into it from behind. On contentious ground, victory belongs to whoever occupies it first, and defeat falls to whoever fails to do so. Therefore, bring your rear units close after the remainder of your forces so that the different parts of your army remain connected.몯 The first part of what Du You said was right 멪 the nature of contentious ground is that whoever occupies it first will win, and the other side will lose. That몭s exactly why it몭s called 몬contentious ground.몭 This makes what you do after you hold the contentious ground, or whether you should hit the enemy with a sneak attack from behind, a moot point. But, the second part of Du You몭s comment 멪 몮Therefore, bring your rear units close after the remainder of your forces so that the different parts of your army are connected몯 멪 shows that he also didn몭t understand the original text. Does he want the rear units to catch up and link together with the forward units so that the army doesn몭t fall apart?
Zhang Yu doubles down on Du You몭s view: 몮In contentious ground speed is a commodity of the highest value; it is not acceptable for your forward units to move quickly ahead while your rear units fail to keep up. Therefore, you should quickly move your rear units forward so that the head and tail of your army arrive together.몯 So, Zhang Yu is interpreting the 몬rear몭 from Sun Tzu몭s original text to mean not the enemy몭s rear, but your own rear. He몭s saying you shouldn몭t get yourself in a situation where your forward units make it to the contentious ground, but your rear units can몭t keep up. He몭s saying that your rear units have to move quickly, too.
By my reckoning, this is much more complicated than what Sun Tzu was actually trying to say.
Zhang Yu also provides an alternative explanation: 몮몬Hurrying up the rear몭 means that although you set out after the enemy, you arrive before him.몯 So, according to this explanation, the 몬rear몭 means that your enemy set out first and you came after 멪 in other words, you followed after the enemy몭s rear. I think it몭s even less likely that Sun Tzu was saying this. What would the point be? He didn몭t care whether you set out before or after the enemy. The point is that you need to get to the destination first.
To sum up, we shouldn몭t over-think things and make them more complicated than necessary. Keep things simple and direct. 몮On contentious ground, I would hurry up the rear.몯 All this means is that when it comes to contentious ground, you need to get there as quickly as possible, find a way to get behind enemy lines, and arrive at the destination before the enemy. Whenever you study ancient texts, or have a real-life experience, ask yourself: 몬What have I learned?몭 Try to understand the writer몭s thinking, not necessarily the literal meaning of the words. You can find the writer몭s thinking in the context and by looking at the book as a whole. If you get it, you get it. But, if you get caught up in entanglements and debates and different interpretations of the meaning of a certain line, or even a handful of words, you몭re doing pointless mental labor. There몭s not much meaning to be found in this kind of work. In particular, don몭t make it into a contest that you have to win 멪 don몭t single-mindedly fixate on coming up with a new theory or an innovative angle to beat other people over the head with.

몮On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses.몯

몮Ground on which each side has liberty of movement몯 멪 this is 몬open ground.몭 These are places where you need to carefully guard your fortifications and cut off the enemy몭s transportation routes.
Du Mu comments: 몮This is about diligently seeing to your fortifications.몯 If the enemy can come at you from any direction, you need to build strong fortifications, dig deep moats and guard them vigilantly.

몮On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.몯

Make sure your enemies don몭t secure alliances with your neighbors before you do, and don몭t let them break up your alliances.
Wang Xi comments: 몮To solidify alliances, use moral virtue and courtesy, prestige and trust, and show them the 몬benefit-and-harm gambit.몭몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Use riches and money to show them benefits, use oaths of alliance to secure the alliance, be firm and consistent; then, they are bound to help you.몯

몮On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies.몯

The crucial thing about serious ground is to take care of your army. Basically, you need grain, animal fodder and other supplies. That몭s because once you몭re deep in enemy territory, your rear units can몭t keep up, and you몭ll need to feed yourself from the enemies몭 resources. In other words, you need to find a local solution to the problem of keeping your army fed and supplied. Cao Cao comments: 몮It is about plundering from the enemy.몯
When we talk about the Second World War, why do people say that China made an enormous sacrifice and contribution? It몭s because China consistently and firmly refused to surrender. As a result, Japan couldn몭t secure all of China몭s resources for its war effort and instead had to spend a huge amount of its own resources fighting there.

몮On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.몯

When you몭re in difficult ground 멪 terrain with mountains and forests, other obstructions, or dangerous terrain features, marshes and swamps 멪 you need to quickly pass through the area.
Cao Cao comments: 몮This is about passing quickly through and leaving.몯
Li Quan comments: 몮It is not permissible to stay in such places.몯
In summary, make your way through these places quickly. You mustn몭t delay. If you do, and your enemy strands you, you몭re in serious trouble.

몮On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat.몯

If you find yourself in hemmed-in ground and surrounded by the enemy, you need to block whatever gap in the encirclement might offer escape.
But why would you want to block your one chance for escape? The Art of War tells us: 몮When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.몯 When your enemy surrounds you, they leave a gap for you to escape through because they몭re worried that otherwise you몭ll fight like a cornered animal. If your men have a way out, they몭ll lose their will to fight to the death and instead head straight for the escape route that the enemy has intentionally left open. As soon as your men run, the enemy will capitalize on their eagerness to make it home alive, cutting off groups of your soldiers, walling them in and attacking until there몭s nothing left of your army. That몭s why you should block up the hole yourself and tell your men that there몭s nowhere to run, and the only option is to fight like madmen. If you do that, you can turn the situation around and actually have a chance to hit the enemy so hard that their lines shatter. Also, the fact that the enemy intentionally left a gap for you means that it will be surrounded by enemy troops waiting to ambush you. If you block it up, the enemy has no way to know from which direction you몭ll try to break through the encirclement.
When Gao Huan, also known as Emperor Shenwu of Northern Qi, first raised his army in Hebei, he fought a battle at Yenan against the combined forces of Erzhu Zhao, Erzhu Tianguang, Erzhu Dulu and Erzhu Zhongyuan. At the time, the army of Erzhu, Erzhu and Erzhu was a formidable force known as the 몬Great Army of 200,000.몭 It managed to surround Gao Huan몭s army of 2,000 cavalry and 30,000 infantry at Nanling Mountain. The Erzhus left a single way out for Gao Huan몭s army, so that his men would have an escape route, and then they got ready to annihilate him. But that didn몭t happen. Instead, Gao Huan gathered his army몭s cattle and donkeys, tied them all together, and put them right in the way of the escape route, blocking it off. His men could see there was nowhere to run, so they fought for their lives, striking the enemy hard on all sides and ultimately inflicting a heavy defeat on the Erzhus.

몮On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of keeping their lives.몯

When on desperate ground, you need to show your men that you몭ve made up your mind to embrace death.
Cao Cao comments: 몮This is about rousing the soldiers몭 spirits.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮This is about making clear to the soldiers that death is inevitable; make them stoke their inner fire so that they may seek life.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Burn the heavy wagons, throw out the food, block the wells and demolish the cooking ranges so as to show the soldiers that there is no hope of survival and to incite them to fight unto death.몯
Shout something along the lines of, 몮The wagons and the food are burned, the well is blocked, the cooking ranges are smashed; there몭s no life for us now. Now fight with me!몯


The way of hegemons and kings: To strike iron, make yourself harder than iron

Extract from the original text:
몮For it is the soldier몭s disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger. We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring lords until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country 멪 its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides. To be ignorant of any one of the following four and five principles is inconsistent with the way that hegemons and kings use military force. When a hegemon or a king attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy몭s forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He unfurls his own personal designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.몯

Meng Shi comments: 몮When sunk in peril, none of the soldiers will not obey.몯 There몭s nothing they can do, except do exactly what you tell them to.
Zhang Yu writes about a historical example of this principle: Ban Chao몭s diplomatic expedition, which we looked at earlier in the book. Ban Chao was sent as an envoy to the Western Regions, to the kingdom of Shanshan. When he and a small contingent of men first arrived, they were treated with warm hospitality by the King of Shanshan. However, the sovereign suddenly turned cold. Ban Chao made some enquiries and found out that another foreign emissary had arrived in Shanshan, from the Xiongnu nomadic confederation. So, was Shanshan going to go with the Xiongnu, or with the Han Emperor? If Shanshan made an alliance with the Xiongnu, Ban Chao and his men likely would have been executed as a gift to the Xiongnu diplomat. Ban Chao had just 36 men with him, and they were definitely 몬sunk in peril.몭
Faced with this situation, Ban Chao assembled his men and told them his plan. Frankly, it was startling. They would launch a direct attack on the Xiongnu diplomatic team and kill every last one of them. The King of Shanshan would never be able to explain to the Xiongnu leaders how their men ended up dead on his watch, so his only choice would be to ally with the Han Emperor.
Hundreds of miles from home, in the capital city of a foreign country, Ban Chao was asking the handful of men under his command to do something truly audacious. He was daring enough to do it, but what about his men? Ban Chao treated them to wine, and then explained clearly to them the danger they were in. He asked what they wanted to do: let the King of Shanshan hand them over to the Xiongnu, so that the jackals and wolves could gnaw on their bones, or do something truly great, which would make them rich in this life and immortal heroes in the history books. The men said: 몮Today we are in the land of death. We will follow you into battle, whether we are to live or die.몯 They handed their lives over to Ban Chao. Under cover of night they launched a surprise attack, setting fire to the Xiongnu diplomat몭s campsite and killing the men inside. The next day, they took the diplomat몭s head to the King of Shanshan. Terrified, the king decided to send his son as a hostage to the Han Emperor. He had accepted an alliance with the Han Empire.

몮We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring lords until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country 멪 its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.몯


So, if you don몭t know what other countries are planning, or what they want, you can몭t design a foreign policy. In the story of Ban Chao, if he hadn몭t known about the King of Shanshan몭s situation, or the movements of the Xiongnu, he could never have acted so decisively.
If you don몭t know the lay of the local mountains, forests, marshes, swamps and other dangerous terrain features, you can몭t move your army through the area. If you don몭t employ a local guide, you won몭t be able to take advantage of the best terrain.
Cao Cao comments: 몮These three matters have already been expounded upon above. Here, they are repeated, so as to vigorously express that one must absolutely not take military action.몯
The reason these three principles are repeated is to emphasize their importance.

몮To be ignorant of any one of the following four and five principles is inconsistent with the way that hegemons and kings use military force.몯

What exactly is meant by 몬the following four or five principles?몭 Cao Cao comments: 몮This is about the benefits and dangers inherent in the nine terrain situations. An alternative formulation is: 몬the four and five issues.몭몯 Four plus five equals nine, so 몬the four and five principles몭 means 몬the nine terrain types.몭 Some people have a different interpretation, suggesting that it몭s not a reference specifically to 몬the nine terrain types,몭 but a more general reference to the various principles introduced above.
In the original text, this passage could be interpreted either to mean 몬hegemonic kings몭 or 몬hegemons and kings.몭 The correct meaning is 몬hegemons and kings.몭 A hegemon is a regional lord, while a king is someone who can claim to rule the known world. So, hegemons and kings are different categories, with differing status and existing within different boundaries. A hegemon is someone who is feared, someone who everyone submits to and obeys. He몭s in charge, and his role is like that of the oldest brother in a clan. Separately, a king is someone who the whole populace recognizes as their lord; he몭s like the father of his country.

몮When a hegemon or a king attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy몭s forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.몯

By attacking a powerful country in the manner of a hegemon or a king, you cause the enemy몭s country to collapse from the inside, rendering them unable to assemble their army. Make a show of force to psychologically dominate them, and they몭ll be unable to build friendly relations with other countries.
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮When invading large countries, being able to divide the populace ensures you can command an abundance of authority and power, and then you can impose your authoritativeness upon the enemy, inspiring fear in neighboring countries and rendering it impossible for your enemy to seek allies.몯 
When you command military strength that is truly earthshaking, your enemy fears your power, and this fear handicaps their ability to raise an army. As word of your power reverberates through the land, nearby countries will be paralyzed and horrified at the thought of getting on your bad side. So, nobody will be eager to hold out a hand of friendship to your enemy.
For example, when the states of Jin and Chu went to war over control of the state of Zheng, if Jin won, Zheng would become a Jin vassal. If Chu won, Zheng would turn its back on Jin and become a Chu vassal. This is how a big country practices The Way of the Hegemon 멪 by winning wars and annexing smaller countries, thus becoming even stronger.

몮Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He unfurls his own personal designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.몯

Therefore, there몭s no need to spend time and effort building alliances with other countries, or to help build up another country몭s military strength. Just flex your muscles and let your intentions be known. Exert your aura of power on your enemy, and then you can easily take their cities and reduce their country to rubble.
Du Mu comments: 몮The character 몬xin몭 (which usually means 몬trust몭) here means 몬shen몭 (몬unfurl몭).몯 This passage tells the general to not form ties with foreign forces, nor to use the stratagem of building power, but to flaunt the power of his army and exert the pressure that arises from it upon enemy countries. High importance is placed on carrying out one몭s personal desires; if you do this, the enemy몭s cities can be plucked from their hands and their country destroyed.몯
Jia Lin comments: 몮The various feudal princes will fear you. They will be unable to bring their people together and they will not dare to ally with other countries. You can call upon an abundance of authoritativeness and intelligent planning capabilities, and the various feudal princes will naturally align with you. What need is there to foster alliances?몯
Chen Hao comments: 몮Commanding ample wisdom and strength, authority rests in your hands. Foster only your own soldiers; this is how to make yourself invincible, and all the feudal princes in the world will have no authority to call upon. Benevolence, righteousness and wisdom will be your personal assets, owned by nobody else, and you can use them to unite the people. Thus, it is said: 몬Unfurling my personal designs, my authority shakes all under heaven, my moral virtue shines over the four seas, my grace blesses all things, and trust in me pervades all beings even unto pigs and fishes. The hearts of the common people are mine and nobody even entertains the notion of not submitting to me. Thus, I will inevitably take the enemy몭s cities; when I invade, their country is bound to fall.몯
Chen Hao is talking about The Way of Kings, which applies to all living things in the world, not just to the people of one몭s own country. Even the birds and beasts are included. An example of this, which we discussed earlier in the book, is the story of Shang Tang, the legendary founder of the ancient Shang dynasty (1600-1046 BCE), and how he 몬left the net open on three sides.몭
Shang Tang was outside of the city when he saw a hunter putting up nets to catch birds. The hunter was arranging the nets in a square shape, with no way out. He muttered while he worked: 몮Any bird that comes from the sky and any beast that comes from the earth; any creature coming from any direction; here they all come, straight into my net.몯 From the tempo of the hunter몭s work, it seemed he was hell-bent on catching as many animals as he possibly could. Shang Tang approached him, and said: 몮If you act this way, you will hunt the animals until there are none left! This is the evil influence of King Jie of Xia; if it were not for his example, who would behave in this way?몯 Shang Tang told the hunter to take down his nets on three sides, leaving only one side remaining. Then, he taught the hunter a new song. Loosely translated into a more modern form, it reads like this:
몮When a spider weaves its web,
It only weaves on one side!
Let me be like the spider
To set my nets and catch the birds!
When I go setting nets
And hunting birds!
Go left, if you like,
Or right, if you like,
Or up high, if you like,
Or down low, if you like.
Three sides free to fly,
One side for my net.
Fly into my net,
If you insist,
And if that is your lousy fate.
I몭ll take the birds
Who throw their life away,
And to the rest I say,
Fly free and godspeed!몯

News of Shang Tang몭s good deed spread, and when people in other countries heard about it, they exclaimed: 몮Tang몭s virtue reaches even the birds and the beasts!몯 If Shang Tang몭s good deeds extended even to animals, imagine how kind he must be in his dealings with human beings! After that, 40 countries and states submitted to him.
The moral of the story is that, even if you set up nets on four sides, you won몭t necessarily catch any birds. Shang Tang removed the nets on three sides and managed to catch 40 countries in his one remaining net. He wasn몭t in the business of catching birds!
There몭s another story about Shang Tang. He was once building a house, and while digging the foundation his shovel unearthed a human skeleton. The workers made as if to dispose of it, but Shang Tang said: 몮This is our countryman, you know!몯 Then, treating the nameless skeleton with the utmost dignity and respect, he gave it a proper burial. When this story spread, people all over the world exclaimed: 몮If Tang몭s virtue reaches even the dead, then imagine how well he must treat the living!몯 
Then, the common people gave their hearts to Shang Tang, and there was nobody who even considered not submitting to him. And what was the result? When Shang Tang began launching military campaigns all over China, if he attacked countries in the east, people in the west would be unhappy: 몮What몭s Tang doing fighting in the east? Why isn몭t he attacking us? How we wish that he would come and be our ruler!몯 Then, after Shang Tang turned his armies west, the people in the east were most displeased: 몮He hasn몭t finished the job over here yet! Why몭s he going west?몯
And that is how Shang Tang unified all the lands of China.
The lesson is that if you몭re going to strike iron, the key is to make yourself harder than iron. This is The Way of Hegemons and Kings. Once your economy, culture, military and government administration are more advanced than your rivals몭, you can roll out The Way of Hegemons and Kings around the world. You won몭t need to bother with building alliances or calculating who to fight and who to seduce into a partnership 멪 that몭s not what hegemons and kings do. For example, at one time the United States had ambitions to win over the hearts and minds of the common people: The Way of Kings. When the US first invaded Iraq, I몭d guess that many Libyans wished the American military was coming to their country. In fact, America was unable to continue to bear the responsibility it had taken upon itself.
US President Barack Obama didn몭t understand the one rule that is the bare minimum for anyone wishing to be a world leader. Being a world leader means sacrificing yourself for the sake of the world. If you sacrifice nothing at all, what qualifies you to lead others?  If you refuse to make any kind of blood sacrifice, and instead try to rule the world purely through diplomacy and building up other countries, you몭re doomed to be nothing more than a world-class laughingstock.


To emerge victorious, you must lay aside all fear and doubt

Extract from the original text:
몮Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man. Use them only to achieve things; never tell them your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.몯

Analysis:
몮Bestow rewards without regard to law, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements멞몯
Acting 몬without regard to rule몭 or to 몬previous arrangements몭 is about breaking with convention.
Jia Lin comments: 몮If you wish to take an enemy city or destroy an enemy country, then dangle rewards before your men that exceed your established laws; give commands which are infused with your authoritativeness and which transcend your normal administration. This is about breaking with the ordinary rules and administration, and thus it is said: 몬Act without regard to law or previous arrangements.몭몯
The prospect of massive reward brings daring men out of the woodwork. That몭s why you have to offer rewards that seem to go beyond the remit of your laws and rules when you want to take a city. War is a time of extraordinary circumstances, so you have to command in an extraordinary manner; you have to go against the usual way of doing things.
This is all for the sake of victory. Don몭t tie yourself to the normal rules; make up whatever 몬special몭 rules the circumstances demand.

몮멞 and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮The character 몬fan몭 (which normally means 몬violate몭) here means 몬yong몭 (몬use몭). This passage says that one must make clear what the rewards are, and to use your army as though it were only a single man, even if it is of great size.몯
This is a principle we몭ve come across many times already: to command a large number of men, lead them as though they몭re few in number.

몮Use them only to achieve things; never tell them your design.몯

Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Use soldiers only to fight battles; do not tell them your plans.몯
Wang Xi comments: 몮When information is leaked, plans go awry.몯
When you몭re trying to accomplish something, only tell your soldiers what to do. Don몭t explain why. If more than a handful of people know why you몭re doing something, an intelligence leak becomes highly likely. If that happens, your enemy can work out what your next move will be.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Use them to fight battles, do not discuss matters of planning and authority. When people know your plan, they are prone to doubt.몯
This brings us to the second issue. If you tell your men why you몭re making such-and-such a move, they몭ll start thinking and analyzing, and it will be impossible to stop them from doubting your plan. Once your men have doubts, they몭ll lose their determination to get on with their job.
In an earlier example, we saw how General Pei Xingjian몭s men had just finished setting up camp when he ordered them to take down their tents and move to higher ground. He didn몭t give them any reason for this command, and his men were reluctant to obey. They did, though, and that night a huge rainstorm came and flooded the campsite they몭d abandoned. After that, everyone in the army had nothing but admiration for Pei Xingjian!
Now, let몭s imagine that Pei Xingjian had explained his reasoning when he gave the order to move camp: 몮It몭s possible there will be a big rainstorm tonight. That몭s why I몭m telling you to hurry up and move to higher ground.몯 Then the troops would have started talking among themselves. Some of them would have argued that Pei was right and it was indeed going to rain; others would insist it wasn몭t going to rain. And, if it wasn몭t going to rain, they몭d figure they should rest instead of making life hard for themselves멞 and so on. Tongues would start wagging.
If the rainstorm did materialize that evening, General Pei would come off as a wise man. If it didn몭t, getting his men to do as he said would become much more difficult the next time round. By not telling them a reason, even if it didn몭t rain, they몭d never make the connection between being ordered to move camp and whether or not it would rain that night. In the minds of the soldiers, their general would be an inscrutable leader, impossible to second guess and always acting for his own reasons. Their role is to do as he says, and nothing more.
As a general, you have to make your soldiers trust you completely; leave no room for doubt in their minds. There몭s a relation between trust and not doubting 멪 trust is the reason, and soldiers who never doubt you is the objective. So, the best course of action is to not give your soldiers the choice between trusting and not trusting; go straight to making sure they never doubt you.
Confucius made the same point when he said: 몮The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it.몯 Don몭t get everyone in your organization involved in analyzing decisions. The more they analyze, the more ideas they have and the more they start to worry. Then, everything turns into an opaque muddle.

몮When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.몯


Cao Cao comments: 몮Do not make them aware of danger.몯
Wang Xi comments: 몮This is about worry, doubt and fear.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮It is the human disposition to advance upon seeing gain and to hide upon gaining knowledge of danger; thus, do not tell them about danger.몯
In the previous passage 멪 몮Use them only to achieve things; never tell them your design몯 멪 Sun Tzu advises us not to let the soldiers think, and not to let them make their own judgments or feel doubt. Get them to do their job with single-minded focus. This passage 멪 몮When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy몯 멪 instructs us only to tell our soldiers about things that they can get some gain from and not to tell them about danger. It몭s human nature to go after attractive things and stay well away from the bad. You need to make your men see only gain, so that they put aside their attachment to life. You mustn몭t let them see danger, or they몭ll get scared and have doubts, and they won몭t have the courage to move forward.
Ideally, make sure your men feel no doubt and no fear.


Walking out alive from a death trap: Who truly has what it takes?

Extract from the original text:
몮Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm몭s way that is capable of striking a blow for victory.몯

Analysis:
The only way to keep your army whole is to place it in a deathtrap, and the only way to survive is to put it in a desperate situation. This is because the only way to seize the wheel of victory and failure is to plunge your troops into a place of certain death.
Cao Cao comments: 몮You must engage in life-and-death battles; you cannot be defeated when you are in a desperate situation. Sun Bin said: 몬The most frightening proposition for an army is to not be plunged into desperate straits.몭 Without being in a place of danger and difficulty, the soldiers몭 minds will not be focused. Being in a situation of danger and difficulty, then victory and defeat are in the hands of your men.몯
Unless your men are in mortal peril, they몭ll never be able to focus their wills and their minds, transcend the questions of life and death, and fight as though their lives depends on it. That몭s because unless they몭re in mortal peril, they몭ll always have other choices open to them. That is why you have to put them in a situation of certain death; it몭s the only way for them to break out from their own personal little worlds and defeat your enemies.
Of course, if we몭re going to talk about historical examples of 몬walking out alive from a death trap,몭 we have to once again mention Han Xin몭s gambit, fighting with his back to a deep river. However, although Han Xin plunged his soldiers into a situation of certain death, he also had other plans: 2,000 cavalry waiting elsewhere. He was very clear that he몭d left himself an out. 
But there was a general who really did plunge all of his own men, and all of the enemy몭s men, into mortal peril. That general is Chen Qingzhi, and it happened at the Battle of Guoyang.
Chen Qingzhi was a famous general of the Liang dynasty, during the Dynasties period (386멨589 CE). People called him 몬The God of War,몭 and it몭s said that Mao Zedong revered him above any other ancient general. Chen몭s wartime achievements are so dazzling that they beggar belief. As a result, there몭s an ongoing debate about whether what the history books say about him is true.
Chen Qingzhi laid siege to the Northern Wei city of Guoyang, which today is the city of Mengcheng in Anhui Province. From spring to winter, the two armies fought dozens of battles, and eventually Chen몭s men grew dispirited, officers and soldiers alike tottering at the brink of total exhaustion. Then, a Northern Wei relief force showed up and built a camp behind the Liang army몭s position. Chen몭s officers were horrified 멪 facing the prospect of being hit in the belly and the back at the same time, they were all anxious to retreat. Then, Chen Qingzhi spoke: 몮Since we came here, we have spent a year fighting, at great expense of money and grain. And yet, you all have lost your appetite for fighting, and now you want to cower away. The enemy has surrounded us. What could be better! As I see it, we are now in a situation of certain death, and so we will survive. Once they have us completely surrounded, then the soldier will be ready to fight to the death. That will be the moment of our victory!몯
Throughout the history of war, generals all feared being 몬wrapped up like a dumpling,몭 but Chen Qingzhi actually welcomed the idea, because he thought that it was the only way to unleash his soldiers몭 ferocity.
Sure enough, the Northern Wei army built 13 camps in a tight circle around the Liang army. Chen Qingzhi led his men into action under the cover of night, knocked out four of the enemy camps, and secured the surrender of the Guoyang garrison commander, Wang Wei. Then, Chen picked out 13 enemy prisoners and released them to go back to the Northern Wei camps and spread the news of the Northern Wei defeat. At the same time, Chen and his army followed close on the heels of the surrendered enemy troops, taking advantage of their momentum to attack and destroy the remaining nine enemy camps. The entire Northern Wei army was wiped out.


Loyal advice: you might not want to hear it, but it몭s to your own advantage to act on It; Beware of advisors who scrape and bow, they have treachery in their hearts

Extract from the original text:
몮Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy몭s purpose. By massing our soldiers in a single direction and advancing upon the enemy, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief. This is called the ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning. On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries. Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation. If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in. Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and do not fight on any fixed day or time. Tread the inked line and follow the enemy, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle. At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards, emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.몯

Analysis:
몮Success in warfare is gained by accommodating ourselves to the enemy몭s purpose.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮An alternative formulation is: 몬If the enemy is poised to advance, set an ambush and retreat; if the enemy is poised to withdraw, open up and strike.몭몯
Basically, to get something you have to give something. Directing the course of a battle is about going along with the enemy몭s desires, giving them a sense of accomplishment, getting them to let their guard down, and then attacking.
Du Mu comments: 몮Accommodate yourself to the enemy몭s purpose. That is why Sun Tzu says that if you want to strike the enemy but see no vulnerabilities, then you must hide your army and conceal all traces of yourself. Whatever the enemy might do, accommodate him and do nothing to startle him. If he tries to overawe you with aggression, then you must make yourself seem cowardly and hide. Accommodate his aggression in order to make him arrogant. Wait until his vigilance slackens and then attack. If the enemy wants to withdraw whence he came, then open a gap in your encirclement so that he may depart. Pursue and strike him as he retreats. The purpose in all of these actions is to accommodate the enemy.몯
If you want to inflict damage on the enemy, the principle is always the same: go along with what they want and let them be the makers of their own undoing. That몭s why, although it can be unpleasant to hear honest advice from a loyal advisor, evil advisors always fawn over you and go along with whatever you say.


몮By massing our soldiers in a single direction and advancing upon the enemy, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief. This is called the ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.몯

몮Massing our soldiers in a single direction and advancing upon the enemy몯 is about throwing the full force of your entire army at a single point in the enemy lines.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Massing our soldiers in a single direction and advancing upon the enemy, we shall be able to capture their general even if we must first travel 1,000 li to reach him. This is what is called the ability to accomplish things through sheer cunning.몯
The knack of dictating how a battle unfolds is about pretending to go along with what the enemy wants, making him drop his guard, and then stealthily massing your forces and striking with speed and in a single direction, capturing and killing the enemy officers and soldiers. This is how to use cunning to get things done.
Our historical example for this section is one we몭ve seen before: the story of how the Xiongnu chieftain Modun defeated the Donghu people. Modun had seized the throne after killing his father, Chanyu Touman. While he was still new on the throne, the Donghu thought they could bully him. They sent an envoy with this message: 몮Your father, Touman, had a terrific horse, a very fast horse. How about you hand it over?몯 Modun몭s advisors said that the Donghu had no manners, but Modun replied: 몮It몭s just a horse, why shouldn몭t we give it as a gift to our friends?몯 So, he gave away the horse.
Another Donghu envoy arrived and asked if Modun would give them one of his wives, since he had so many. His advisors were furious and exclaimed that this was a terrible insult, and an army must be sent to punish the Donghu. But Modun said: 몮It몭s just a woman, why not give one to our Donghu brothers?몯
So, he gave away one of this wives.
Now it wasn몭t just the Donghu who thought Modun was weak and an easy target; even Modun몭s own advisors gave up on him. After a while, another Donghu envoy arrived. The envoy said that there was a 1,000-li stretch of deserted land between the Xiongnu and Donghu territories. This land had no owner, so would Modun be willing to draw a new border and recognize it as Donghu territory?
Modun called another meeting of his advisors. Some of them thought: since you didn몭t have any problems giving away your own wife, what몭s a piece of deserted land worth? You might as well give it away; why are you even asking us? 
Modun flew into a rage:
몮The land is the very substance of our country! How could I give it away?몯 He killed the advisors who몭d suggested giving up the land, immediately raised an army, and launched a long-distance surprise attack on the Donghu, who were totally unprepared. The Donghu king was killed, and their land, people and livestock became Modun몭s property.

몮On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of enemy emissaries.몯

This is about the need to keep your secrets. Cao Cao comments: 몮Having determined your plan, close the passes, every transmission of enemy travel, and do not allow passage to their emissaries.몯
Once you몭ve decided to go to war, close the mountain passes, cancel and invalidate all travel documents, forbid all travel by civilians, and don몭t let any enemy agents into your territory. This is how to prevent leaks of military intelligence and stop the enemy from finding out anything about your situation.

몮Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.몯

When making major military decisions, do it in the temple, in conditions of strict secrecy.
Du Mu comments: 몮Hold discussions in the temple, control the whole process. Having already established what the outcome will be, mobilize your armies.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Major military issues must not be discussed lightly; they ought to be discussed in the temple, with the proper reverence and sternness. Control the situation; information about important plans must not be allowed to circulate outside the temple.몯
So, there are two levels of meaning here. First, plan first and act later, or win first and fight later. Second, do your planning in seclusion and make absolutely sure to keep it secret.

몮If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮If there is a vulnerability in the enemy lines, rush in.몯
However, this can also result in your own defeat. The enemy몭s 몬vulnerability몭 might be a trick designed to lure you in.

몮Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and do not fight on any fixed day or time.몯


몮Seizing what he holds dear몯 is about occupying whichever strategic location the enemy is most attached to. For example, when Li Shimin went to war against Dou Jiande, he occupied Hulao Pass and blocked Dou Jiande from entering his territory through the pass. Cao Cao comments: 몮This is about controlling the most advantageous and expedient factors.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮This is about seizing whatever the enemy몭s war effort depends upon.몯 This could be a strategic location, or it could also be food, fodder and supply wagons. 
The next part, 몮do not fight on any fixed day or time,몯 requires quite a lot of explaining.
Cao Cao comments: 몮Setting out after the enemy but arriving before him.몯 That몭s all well and good, but Cao Cao hasn몭t explained the meaning of the passage.
Du Mu comments: 몮Here, 몬subtly,몭 a misinterpretation of the character wei (윫[bd44]), refers to concealment. The character qi refers to a location to which the enemy is attached for the advantages it offers; the general must occupy this location, and so he must secretly travel there so as not to make the enemy aware.몯
Du Mu몭s interpretation of 몬subtly,몭 as referring to concealment, makes perfect sense. There are several Chinese words and terms in which this character (wei) is used to mean 몬in concealment.몭 However, his claim that qi means 몬that which is desired몭 doesn몭t match up with the grammar of the sentence. The subject of the verb qi is 몬the general,몭 not the enemy. So, this interpretation doesn몭t fully make sense.
Du Mu isn몭t the only commentator to interpret the passage this way. Chen Hao, Mei Yaochen and Wang Xi all agree with him, and all four of them were influenced by Cao Cao몭s comment. But, what connection is there between Cao Cao몭s comment 멪 몬setting out after the enemy but arriving before him몭 멪 and 몬subtly contrive?몯 The commentators argue that 몬subtly몭 is about casually leaking information to the enemy. The reasoning is that if you occupy a location, but the enemy doesn몭t know you몭re there, he won몭t come. And what are you supposed to do then? You have to subtly leak information to the enemy so that he몭ll come, and only then can you fight him.
With all due respect, I think the four commentators overthought this one. Their explanations, along with Du Mu몭s and Cao Cao몭s, left me unsatisfied. So, I went to the Academy of Military Science of the Chinese People몭s Liberation Army to look for the book, A Translation of Sun Tzu몭s Art of War with Annotations, by academy vice president General Guo Huaruo. His comment on this passage was very simple: don몭t arrange with the enemy to set a date for the battle.
After further investigation, I found that the words conventionally translated as 몬subtly contrive몭 (wei yu) actually mean 몬don몭t do it this way.몭 There몭s a well-known phrase in Chinese, 몭Poor man come; here몭s food,몭 which means food that is donated with contempt.몯 Originally, it comes from a passage of the ancient text, The Book of Rites, from the chapter entitled Tan Gong II.  This is the relevant passage:
몮During a great famine in Qi, Qian Ao had food prepared on the roads, to wait the approach of hungry people and give to them. (One day), there came a famished man, looking as if he could hardly see, his face covered with his sleeve, and dragging his feet together. Qian Ao, carrying with his left hand some rice, and holding some drink with the other, said to him, 'Poor man! Come and eat.' The man, opening his eyes with a stare, and looking at him, said, 'It was because I would not eat (when told) 몬Poor man come; here's food,몭 that I am come to this state.' Qian Ao immediately apologized for his words, but the man would not take the food and died. When Zengzi heard the circumstances, he said, 몬Do not behave like this! When the other expressed his pity as he did, the man could have gone away. When he apologized, the man could have taken the food.몭몯
When the starving man refused to eat the 몬poor man, come몭 food that Zengzi had offered, Zengzi used the same phrase from the Sun Tzu passage (wei yu), followed by: 몮You몭re within your rights to turn down the offer when a man calls you 몬poor man,몭 but it also would have been perfectly acceptable to eat the food after he apologizes.몯 A commentator on the text named Zheng Xuan wrote: 몮Wei is used in the same way as the word 몬don몭t.몭 The intent of the passage is to tell the starving man not to speak so imprudently.몯 The scholar Kong Yingda commented: 몮Wei means 몬do not.몭 Yu is merely an auxiliary word. The passage means: 몬Starving people should not behave in such a way!몭몯
So, wei yu means 몬don몭t.몭 There are further examples of wei being used in this way, such as in Memorial to Yueyang Tower, by Fan Zhongyan.
The relevant passage from Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War is typically translated as, 몮Subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground몯 actually means, 몬War isn몭t a gentleman몭s duel; don몭t arrange with your enemy to set a time and place for the battle.몭 You need to be prepared to take the enemy by surprise at any moment, and to attack where he몭s unprepared. This explanation is the only one that makes sense in the context of the rest of The Art of War.

몮Tread the inked line and follow the enemy, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle.몯

몮Tread the inked line and follow the enemy.몯 This line raises more questions. The 몬inked line몭 means 몬convention몭 or 몬customary rules.몭 When a carpenter needs to cut wood to make a piece of furniture, the first thing he does is draw an inked line on the wood, which he then cuts along. But, in the original Chinese, it몭s unclear whether 몬tread몭 means that you should follow the rules or go against them.
You몭d think that it would mean you should follow the rules. After all, that몭s the normal meaning of 몬tread the line.몭 But in ancient Chinese, the word for tread is interchangeable with another word of the same pronunciation that means to cut or eliminate. So, it would also be correct to interpret it as meaning 몬don몭t follow the rules.몭 
Du Mu says that it means you should follow the customary rules: 몮The word 몬ink몭 here refers to 몬customary rules.몭 The meaning is that you must always tread the line of the customary rules, staunchly follow the system of rules and follow enemy몭s situation closely; if there is any opportunity to exploit, advance and prepare to fight a decisive battle.몯
But, Jia Lin interprets it to mean that you shouldn몭t follow the rules: 몮Here, the word 몬tread몭 means 몬to tread on.몭 The word 몬ink몭 means 몬rules.몭 Follow closely the enemy몭s plans in order to engage in a decisive battle and accomplish your task. Advantageous conditions are what bring victory; you must not base all of your actions upon conforming to the rules.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮When treading the inked line, do not always act the same way.몯 He doesn몭t say whether 몬treading the inked line몭 means 몬obey the rules몭 or 몬disobey the rules.몭 He몭s saying that when you do obey the rules, don몭t always stick to convention.
General Guo Huaruo comments: 몮When implementing your war plans, you need to be flexible in following changes in the enemy몭s situation and correct your plans accordingly. This should inform your decisions about what course of military action to take.몯 This is the correct explanation.

몮At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards, emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮Make yourself seem weak like a maiden, then fly like a hare on the run.몯


Appendix: Complete text of The Nine Situations

Sun Tzu said: 몮The art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) Facile ground; (3) Contentious ground; (4) Open ground; (5) Ground of intersecting highways; (6) Serious ground; (7) Difficult ground; (8) Hemmed-in ground; (9) Desperate ground. When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground. When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground. Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side is contentious ground. Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has the world at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground. Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens 멪 all country that is hard to traverse 멪 this is difficult ground. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed-in ground. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay is desperate ground. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy몭s way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies. On serious ground, gather in plunder. In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight. Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy몭s front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men. When the enemy troops were scattered, they prevented them from assembling, and when the enemy몭s men were pressed together, they prevented them from uniting. When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: 몬Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.몭 Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy몭s unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots. The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you. Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food. Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move, and devise unfathomable plans. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve. Officers and men alike will put forth their utmost strength. Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard. Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the alert; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted. Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared. If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity. On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears run down their cheeks. But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Gui. The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuairan. Now, the shuairan is a snake that is found in the Chang Mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the shuairan, I should answer, 몬Yes.몭 For the men of Wu and the men of Yue are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other몭s assistance just as the left hand helps the right. Hence it is not enough to put one몭s trust in the squaring of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground. The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard of courage which all must reach. How to make the best of both strong and weak 멪 that is a question involving the proper use of ground. Thus, the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, whether he likes it or not, by the hand. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance. By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose. At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nobody knows whither he is going. To muster his host and bring it into danger: this may be termed the business of the general. The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied. On contentious ground, I would hurry up the rear. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses. On ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances. On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of supplies. On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road. On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat. On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness of keeping their lives. For it is the soldier몭s disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger. We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring lords until we are acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country 멪 its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides. To be ignorant of any one of the following four and five principles is inconsistent with the way that hegemons and kings use military force. When a hegemon or a king attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy몭s forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He unfurls his own personal designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms. Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do with but a single man. Use them only to achieve things; never tell them your design. When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy. Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm몭s way that is capable of striking a blow for victory. Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy몭s purpose. By massing our soldiers in a single direction and advancing upon the enemy, we shall succeed in the long run in killing the commander-in-chief. This is called the ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning. On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes, destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries. Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation. If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in. Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, and do not fight on any fixed day or time. Tread the inked line and follow the enemy, and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle. At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives you an opening; afterwards, emulate the rapidity of a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.몯


Chapter Twelve: Attack by Fire

Targets to attack with fire

Extract from the original text:
몮There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn depots; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst enemy units.몯

Analysis:
These five 몬ways of attacking with fire몭 correspond to five types of target: personnel, supplies, supply wagons, weapon stores and 몬armed units.몭
Attacking personnel with fire means setting fire to enemy camps and burning enemy soldiers.
After Guan Yu was killed during the Three Kingdoms period, his ally Liu Bei was hungry for revenge. He mobilized his troops and invaded the kingdom of Wu, but his camps were set on fire by Lu Xun and he fled back home, defeated. Soon after, he vomited blood and died. This is an example of targeting enemy personnel with fire. But, this method doesn몭t necessarily involve setting fire to enemy camps. During the chaotic final years of the Tang dynasty, Zhu Wen, who later became Emperor Taizu of the dynasty, found himself with an army in an untamed grassland wilderness, facing off against the combined armies of the military governor of Tianping Circuit, Zhu Xuan, and his brother, Zhu Jin. At first, wind was blowing from the southeast into the face of Zhu Wen몭s army, which frightened his men. After a while, the wind suddenly changed direction; it was now blowing from the northwest. Immediately, Zhu Wen gave the order to start a fire, and soon flames and smoke were billowing into the sky and churning towards the enemy Tianping army. Zhu Wen pressed his advantage, launching a blistering attack, decimating the Tianping army and killing Zhu Xuan.
몬Burning stores몭 is about burning the enemy몭s equipment, food, fodder and whatever other supplies they might have.
During the Chu-Han Contention (206-202 BCE), Liu Bang and Xiang Yu once found themselves in a standoff at Chenggao. Liu Bang몭s Han army had seized a granary, and he wasn몭t worried about running out of food or water. Meanwhile, he sent General Liu Jia with 20,000 infantry and several hundred cavalry to cross White Horse Ford, drive into Chu territory and go about reaping destruction and burning Xiang Yu몭s grain stores. The Chu army was left with even less to eat than before.
During the early years of the Sui dynasty (581-617 CE), Gao Jiong presented a plan to Emperor Wen.  Gao Jiong wanted to destroy the state of Chen, one of the Southern Dynasties, and his plan was to burn Chen몭s supplies. Gao Jiong pointed out that in the southern areas of China, people lived in thatched grass houses, and unlike northern storehouses, which tended to be built underground, southern storehouses were elevated above ground on wooden and bamboo stilts. This was because the south몭s moist ground made it impossible to preserve supplies in underground cellars. These elevated, wooden storehouses were extremely vulnerable to fire. So, Gao Jiong dispatched special forces to go around the state of Chen starting storehouse fires. The southerners would rebuild the structures after they were burned down, but soon after they몭d be burned down again. This constant harassment left the people of Chen in a state of desperate poverty.
A passage from earlier in The Art of War says: 몮An army without bases of supplies is lost.몯 몬Burning stores몭 is about leaving your enemy without any supplies.

몬Burning baggage trains몭 and 몬burning depots몭 are both about burning the same kind of things: supplies. The only difference is that the former is about burning supplies while they몭re being transported, while the latter is about burning them while they몭re in storage.
Du Mu comments: 몮Weapons, equipment, supplies, money and clothes; when in transit on wagons, it is referred to as 몬baggage trains.몭 When in storage inside cities or camps, it is referred to as 몬depots.몭 In both cases, the items are the same.몯
In the Battle of Guandu (200 CE) Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shao by burning his depots.
The most important items under the umbrella of 몬baggage trains몭 and 몬depots몭 aren몭t limited to weapons and foodstuffs; money and its equivalents are also important. Cao Cao wrote: 몮If the army has no funds, the soldiers won몭t come.몯 If you몭re unable to give soldiers cash rewards, you몭ll have a hard time fighting battles.
There are a few different explanations for 몬burning armed units.몭
Li Quan comments: 몮Burning enemy units몭 weaponry.몯
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Burning enemy units몭 weaponry in order to seize their implements of war.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Burning enemy units몭 weaponry in order to render them disunified and lacking implements of war. Hence it is said: 몬Without sharp weapons, it is difficult to contend with the enemy.몭몯
If you burn their flags, they have no signal system for relaying commands; if you burn their weapons, they can몭t fight. It몭s just like in the movies, when soldiers sneak into the enemy camp while everyone몭s asleep and steal all the guns. When they have no guns, all you have to do is send in a single soldier with a gun, and the enemy soldiers will all surrender.
Jia Lin and He Shi몭s comments are different from the others. In their interpretation, 몬army unit몭 should actually be translated as 몬passages,몭 meaning 몬roads.몭 So, the meaning becomes 몬burn the enemy몭s supply routes and destroy their transport links.몭
Other commentators say that it몭s about burning the enemy몭s logistical units, including transport facilities.
So, what did Sun Tzu actually mean? I tend to think it몭s about burning enemy units몭 weaponry, but General Guo Huaruo thinks it몭s about burning enemy supply routes. Sun Tzu can몭t stand up and tell us what the right answer is, but I think that if you manage to set fire to any of the suggestions above, you몭re doing well. If you succeed at burning something of the enemy몭s, you몭ve done a good job. If you don몭t, knowing what the right answer is won몭t do you any good.


When you attack with fire, you몭re basically giving your enemy moxibustion therapy

Extract from the original text:
몮In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.몯

Analysis:
몮In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮The 몬means몭 are 몬guileful people.몭몯 You need to plant agents on the inside.
Li Quan also thinks it몭s about having men on the inside: 몮The 몬means몭 refers to placing guileful people within enemy ranks.몯
Chen Hao comments: 몮You must command factors that are beneficial to you, not only 몬guileful people.몭몯 The key is to have the various things needed for war, not necessarily just men on the inside.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮In any assault involving attack by fire, dry weather is a requirement. If the enemy몭s shelters and structures are built of grass or bamboo, if their stores are concentrated or kept close to undergrowth and brush, then make use of the wind to set fire to them.몯
In the previous historical example, we talked about how Lu Xun defeated Liu Bei by burning down his camps. This happened because Lu Xun realized that the other army몭s structures were built of grass and bamboo, and his stores were concentrated and kept close to undergrowth and brush. In other words, all the preconditions that Sun Tzu mentions were there. When Zhu Wen was preparing to fight Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin, their armies were positioned in an overgrown grassland. As soon as the wind changed, and began blowing towards Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin, Zhu Wen seized his chance and started a fire.
In both of the cases above there was no need to plant a 몬guileful man몭 on the inside. So, when Sun Tzu writes that 몮in order to carry out an attack, we must have means available,몯 the main point is that you need to have the preconditions in order, and you don몭t necessarily need an agent behind enemy lines. Situations that call for planting an agent often revolve around attacking cities. An agent inside an enemy city can start fires as a way to spread chaos, and use the pandemonium as cover to open the city gates and let your soldiers come rushing in from outside.
So, if you몭re defending a city and a fire starts inside your walls, the first thing to do is not to rush to put it out. Instead, secure the gates as your first priority, because that fire was likely started by an enemy agent who몭s trying to distract you.


몮The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮Materials such as mugwort, reeds and rushes, dry grass, and oil must be prepared in advance. Methods which can be used to fight in this way include rockets, fire sickles, 몬fire apricots,몭 몬fire troops,몭 몬fire animals,몭 몬fire birds,몭 몬fire bandits,몭 and 몬fire crossbows.몭몯
몬Fire rockets몭 are made by attaching a small pouch of oil to an arrow. When you hit an enemy building or boat with a fire rocket, the oil pouch bursts, spraying the oil all around. Then, you ignite it by shooting a fire arrow at the same spot. Once a fire has started, you can shoot more fire rockets at the same spot to feed the flames and burn the target to ashes.
몬Fire sickles몭 are objects used to make sparks and start fires. It몭s called a 몬sickle몭 because of its shape, which is curved. When you strike it with a flint, it makes sparks.
몬Fire apricots몭 were another device used in ancient Chinese warfare to hit the enemy with fire. When besieging a city, the attackers would stuff a bundle of mugwort grass inside an apricot pit, light it, tie it onto a bird몭s foot, and let the bird go. The bird takes shelter under the eaves of a building, by which point the apricot pit has completely burned up and the flames catch on the building. With enough fire apricots, you can start fires at many locations, all over an enemy city. The mugwort grass used in fire apricots is the same as the mugwort used today in moxibustion therapy, a traditional Chinese medical treatment. It burns slowly and steadily, and the fire doesn몭t go out until there몭s no mugwort left to burn. If you want to use fire as a weapon, mugwort is an essential item. When you attack with fire, you몭re basically giving your enemy moxibustion therapy.
몬Fire birds몭 are used in combination with fire apricots. They몭re a way to carry a fire source (the fire apricot) and weaponize it.
몬Fire animals몭 employ the same approach as fire birds, using mugwort grass as a fire source. The idea is to catch a wild pig, deer or something similar, light the mugwort, tie it to the animal몭s neck and drive it towards the enemy camp.
There몭s a story from the Spring and Autumn period of making a whole battle line with 몬fire oxen.몭 The state of Yan had invaded the state of Qi, and had already captured over 70 towns and cities. A Qi general named Tian Dan, who led the defense of the city of Jimo, gathered over 1,000 oxen, tied knives onto their horns and oil-dipped reeds to their tails, dressed them in colorful dragon pattern coats, and lit the reeds. Maddened by terrible pain, the oxen charged toward the Yan camp, closely followed by 5,000 of the best Qi warriors. That charge smashed the Yan army to splinters, and soon after the 70 lost cities were recovered. But, does this count as an example of 몬fire animals?몭 Perhaps this could be written up as one especially innovative way to use fire animals, but not what Sun Tzu originally meant.
몬Fire bandits몭 are agents sent behind enemy lines to start fires.
몬Fire troops몭 are cavalry units tasked with starting fires. Equipped with flammable materials and fire starters, they move directly into the enemy camp and set things ablaze.
During the Battle of Guandu, Cao Cao personally led 5,000 infantry and cavalry with a bundle of grass for every man. Using the enemy commander Yuan Shao몭s own flag signals to conceal their identity, they advanced quickly along back roads, under the cover of night, and launched a surprise attack on the town of Wuchao. When they arrived there, they immediately surrounded the place and attacked with fire. This is a classic example of using 몬fire troops.몭
몬Fire crossbows몭 are basically a means of launching fire arrows. At night, prime the crossbows, set the tips of the arrows on fire, shoot several hundred of them at once into the enemy camp, wait for your opponents몭 supplies to burn and for their forces to descend into chaos멞 and then attack.

몮There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.몯

Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Do not use this indiscriminately.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮You must not use this randomly, but should wait for the right time.몯
Being able to start a fire depends on the weather. You can몭t just use fire whenever you want. It몭s important to make sure that all the preconditions are in order, and only then to attack with fire.

몮The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.몯

Zhang Yu comments: 몮When the weather is dry, it is easy to start fires.몯 The right time to start a fire is when both the weather and the materials to be burned are completely dry.
When choosing a day, you need to choose one when the moon is in either 몬The Winnowing Basket,몭 몬The Wall,몭 몬The Wings,몭 or 몬The Chariot,몭 all of which are names of constellations. In ancient Chinese astronomy, 28 constellations were used as reference points when observing the positions of various celestial bodies.
All 28 are close to the equator, and are divided into four groups of seven: 1) In the east, the Azure Dragon, consisting of The Horn, The Neck, The Root, The Room, The Heart, The Tail and The Winnowing Basket; 2) In the north, the Black Tortoise, consisting of The Dipper, The Ox, The Girl, The Emptiness, The Rooftop, The Encampment and the Wall; 3) In the west, the White Tiger, consisting of The Legs, The Bond, The Stomach, The Hairy Head, The Net, The Turtle Beak and The Three Stars; 4) And in the West, the Vermilion Bird, consisting of The Well, The Ghost, The Willow, The Star, The Extended Net, The Wings and The Chariot. It was believed in ancient China that windy weather came while the moon was passing through The Winnowing Basket, The Wall, The Wings and The Chariot. Together, they were known as 몬the four windy constellations.몭 There are similar myths in western culture 멪 for example, the ancient Babylonian name for The Chariot was 몬The Wind Star.몭


Attacking by fire: Five changes

Extract from the original text:
몮In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments: (1) When fire breaks out inside to enemy몭s camp, respond at once with an attack from without; (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy몭s soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack; (3) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favourable moment; (4) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward; (5) A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, and a watch kept for the proper days. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack show strength. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed.몯

Analysis:
몮In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments멞몯
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮As the fire develops, maneuver your forces in response.몯
Whenever you use fire as part of an attack, you need to coordinate your troop movements with the fire as it develops.
The 몬five developments몭 correspond to the five ways of attacking with fire that we looked at earlier: burning personnel, burning stores, burning baggage trains, burning depots and burning enemy units.
So, how do you coordinate troop movements with fire? Sun Tzu writes about each of the five in turn, so it makes sense to explain the 몬five possible developments (of attacking by fire)몭 one by one:

1. 몮When fire breaks out inside the enemy몭s camp, respond at once with an attack from without.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮In all cases involving fire, spread panic and confusion among the enemy and, availing yourself of this, strike. It is not for nothing that fire is said to be a way to defeat one몭s enemies. As soon as you hear that a fire has started, attack immediately. If the fire is extinguished and the enemy soldiers are calm when you attack, then there is no advantage for you. Hence it is said 몬respond at once.몭몯

When you use fire, you몭re not necessarily pinning all your hopes on literally burning the enemy to death. Use it to panic the enemy and then take advantage of the confusion to attack. You should move in as soon as you hear a disturbance in the enemy camp. If you wait until the fire has been put out and the enemy soldiers have calmed down, you might as well not have started a fire in the first place. That몭s why you have to 몬respond at once.몭

2. 몮If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy몭s soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.몯

If a fire starts in the enemy camp but the enemy soldiers remain remarkably calm and quiet, that shows that the opposing general has tight control over his army, that his men are highly trained, and that they were prepared for this scenario. In this case, don몭t attack. Wait for a while and try to make the fire bigger. If you see an opportunity, attack. If you don몭t, you몭d better forget about it.

There is no situation where the only good choice is to attack. Don몭t feel that you몭re wasting your time. It몭s a stronger move to waste your time than to take a beating and limp home, let alone taking a beating and getting trapped, unable to make your way home. If you can attack, then attack. If you can몭t, don몭t. It몭s necessary to know when to stop. A general who by his nature can몭t accept the idea of getting no return on his work 멪 who won몭t stop until he몭s had a 몬proper fight몭 멪 is just lining up for defeat.

3. 몮If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favourable moment.몯

If you start a fire from the outside, you don몭t need to plant an inside man. All you have to do is choose the right time to start the fire.

Li Quan comments: 몮Cao Cao used this stratagem at the Battle of Guandu, to set fire to over ten thousand wagons in Yuan Shao몭s baggage train and defeat him. This demonstrates the meaning of this passage.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮The preceding text says that the five developments of attacking by fire must occur within. But if the enemy camp is situated in a grassy wilderness area, or if the camp몭s stockades of walls can be burned, then you must start a fire immediately rather than wait for an agent behind enemy lines to act. Otherwise, there is a risk that the enemy will take the initiative to burn down the grass around his camp, depriving you of the opportunity to start a fire.몯

If the enemy pre-emptively burns down the grass around his camp, any fire you start won몭t be able to reach their camp.

When a Han dynasty general named Li Ling fought a campaign against the Xiongnu, the Xiongnu forces started a fire upwind of his position. Li Ling rushed to burn down the grass around the perimeter of his camp so that the enemy몭s fire couldn몭t reach him. This is a method to rescue yourself from grassland wildfires.

During the final years of the Eastern Han dynasty, General Huangfu Song finally did battle with Bo Cai, a leader of the Yellow Turban Rebellion. Huangfu Song had taken a defensive position in the city of Changshe (located to the northeast of present-day Changge County City, in Henan Province), and Bo Cai came to lay siege to Changshe at the head of a large army. There were precious few soldiers in the Changshe garrison, and facing attackers who massively outnumbered them fear spread through the ranks of the city몭s defenders. Huangpu Song declared: 몮All manner of strange developments occur in war, and not because of one army having more or less troops than the other. The bandits who oppose us are currently encamped in a grassy area where a fire could easily be started with some assistance from the wind. If a fire is lit under cover of night, then the enemy army is sure to fall into panic and mayhem. At that time, I will send out our forces to attack and we can thus recreate the effect of Tian Dan몭s 몬fire oxen.몭몯

The weather was on his side. That night, a strong wind began to blow. Huangpu Song ordered his men to take unlit torches and assemble atop the city walls, and then sent a squad of elite troops out of the city to start a fire and wildly yell and shout. Then, the men on the city walls lit their torches and joined in the shouting. Huangpu Song rode the momentum his men had created, sounding the war drums and charging forth. The Yellow Turbans panicked and fled in disarray.

4. 몮When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮To do so would not be convenient.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮If the wind blows from the east, then set the fire eastward of the enemy position. Then, launch an attack following the wind and come from the east. If the fire comes from the east, but you attack from the west, then you will suffer the fire몭s depredations just as the enemy does.몯

Du Mu몭s comment explains why Cao Cao says: 몮To do so would be inconvenient.몯

Actually, it would be more than just inconvenient. Zhang Yu comments: 몮When you burn the enemy, they are sure to flee before the fire. If you attack from the direction toward which they몭re fleeing, a fight to the death will surely ensue.몯 If you stand between the enemy and their escape route away from the flames, they몭ll fight for their lives and almost certainly defeat you. Think about it: when an 80-storey building catches fire, people jump from the windows to their certain death rather than being roasted alive. So, of course men fleeing from a fire would be prepared to fight like animals against anyone standing in their way.

That몭s why you set a fire from upwind and don몭t attack from downwind. You can attack from the same direction the fire is moving, or you can attack from the left or the right. Wang Xi comments: 몮One may also strike the enemy몭s left or right flank.몯

During the chaos that enveloped China during the final years of the Sui dynasty, one of the warriors who rose up was a man named Liu Yuanjin. Liu proclaimed himself Son of Heaven, destined to be Emperor, and he commanded a powerful army. To deal with him, Emperor Yang of Sui dispatched his general, Wang Shichong, but Wang was unable to best Liu in battle. Liu Yuanjin was adept at attacking with fire, and every one of his soldiers was always equipped with a handful of reeds because, as Su Tzu wrote, 몮If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favourable moment.몯 He kept his army ready to start a fire at a moment몭s notice. The two sides fought a significant battle at Yanling, where Wang Shichong몭s men were so startled by the fire Liu Yuanjin started that they were about to abandon their camp and flee. Suddenly, the wind changed and began driving the fire back towards Liu몭s own army. Liu몭s camp was burned down and Wang Shichong took advantage of this opportunity to take the fight to his enemy, inflicting a heavy defeat on Liu Yuanjin. Liu never recovered from this setback, suffered a string of defeats, and was eventually beheaded by Wang Shichong.

When you use fire as a weapon, remember that the wind can change.

5. 몮A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls.몯

This observation comes from experience. Cao Cao comments: 몮One should be mindful of this.몯

There몭s a passage from Lao Tzu몭s Tao Te Ching that reads: 몮High winds do not last all morning. Heavy rain does not last all day.몯 It means that anything that moves with frenzied force will not last long. 몮One should be mindful of this.몯

Wind and rain, an army몭s morale, a man몭s vigilance 멪 all of these things are variable, and none of them are unlimited. The art of war is about studying, understanding, balancing and making use of the ebb and flow of these 몬variables,몭 both in your own army and in the enemy몭s.


몮In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, and a watch kept for the proper days.몯


So, it몭s necessary to understand the five different changes that can occur when using fire, stay mindful of these changes and take a flexible approach to using fire.

몮Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack show strength. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed.몯

This is saying that it몭s better to attack with fire than with water.
몮Those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence.몯 Clearly, generals who use fire to aid their attack gain an easier path to victory.
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮One can understand how to easily secure victory.몯
몮Those who use water as an aid to the attack show strength.몯 It is possible to strengthen your attacking position by using water as an aid. So, if you can use fire, you can understand how to win easily, while using water merely strengthens your attack. Why? 
몮By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed.몯 Water can be used to cut off an enemy army몭s movements, but it can몭t deprive them of their supply stores.
But what exactly is the meaning of 몬robbed몭 in this passage? According to all 11 of our commentators, it means 몬robbed of their stores.몭
Cao Cao comments: 몮By using water as an aid, one can sever supply routes and separate enemy forces, but one cannot rob the enemy of their stores.몯 Unlike fire, water cannot burn the enemy몭s grain and wagons.
Personally, I think that the objects being 몬robbed몭 also include the lives of enemy troops. Fire몭s 
몬killing power몭 is much greater than water몭s. Many people can swim, but I몭ve never heard of anyone who can swim through fire. When Japan invaded China in the 1930s, Chiang Kai-shek blew up the levees on the Yellow River at Huayuankou, which only succeeded in slightly delaying the Japanese army and came at a massive cost in lives of the Chinese people.
A lot of stories that involve attacking with water should be taken with a grain of salt. For example, the story of Han Xin drowning Long Qie몭s army 멪 which was cited earlier in the book 멪 is very suspect. According to the tale, Han Xin ordered his soldiers to dam a river using over 10,000 sandbags. While Long Qie몭s army was crossing the depleted river downstream, Han Xin ordered his men to remove the sandbags, releasing the river and drowning Long Qie몭s men. Zeng Guofan researched this story and came to the conclusion that it was physically impossible. If it were possible, Zeng would have very much liked to use the stratagem himself. As noted previously, how could it possible to build a dam capable of holding back enough water to drown a large army with sandbags, and then tear it down with just a few moments몭 work? In hydropower station construction, completing a dam capable of holding back the water is a major engineering project 멪 how could something like that be accomplished with a group of men carrying sandbags? Even if it were possible to build a dam in this way, it would never have been possible to demolish it  at a moment몭s notice. Gunpowder, which could conceivably have been used to blast open a dam, hadn몭t yet been invented.
It would, however, be possible to drown an enemy city if you could surround it and channel a river into the city. During the Spring and Autumn period, Zhi Bo of Jin once coerced the noble houses of Han and Wei into surrounding the house of Zhao, and channeled the Fen River in an attempt to submerge the city of Jincheng. However, Zhi Bo didn몭t get his way in the end. The Zhao leaders persuaded the leaders of Han and Wei to unite, and together they destroyed Zhi Bo. Ultimately, the state of Jin was divided between the three noble houses and became the states of Han, Wei and Zhao, which were three of the seven contending states during the Warring States period.
In conclusion, fire is fast and water is slow.


The key to winning a fight: Can you afford to win?

Being able to afford victory is just as important as being able to afford to lose. If you win a battle but can몭t afford victory, you몭re in serious trouble.
That몭s why generals who always win end up dead. As we몭ve said so often, the key is to settle the war with a single battle.

Analysis:
몮Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste and general stagnation.몯
Our 11 commentators seem to have agreed on how to interpret 몬cultivating the spirit of enterprise몭 and 몬waste and general stagnation.몭 They explain it as referring to a situation where, after a battle, the general doesn몭t hand out rewards quickly enough, which leaves the soldiers wondering what they몭re supposed to do. The army becomes stuck, unable to return home, and all the while the money dwindles and the troops grow old waiting. Cao Cao was the first commentator, and his interpretation may have influenced the others몭 observations. 
Cao Cao comments: 몮Just like water that flows away, it is impossible to return things to their previous state. It could also be expressed like this: the rewards are not dispensed in a timely manner; to make effective use of rewards, one cannot delay until the next day.몯
Cao Cao is saying that you have to give out rewards on the same day as the battle. Any delay will lead to waste and 몬general stagnation.몭
Comments by Li Quan, Jia Lin, Du Mu and Zhang Yu are almost the same as Cao Cao몭s, although with one or two minor differences. Later scholars weren몭t satisfied with this interpretation, and neither am I. The 몬spirit of enterprise몭 that must be cultivated isn몭t just about rewarding soldiers for their service; this is only one small part of it. What this passage is really about is consolidating gains after battle and clarifying the political situation.
It bodes poorly for any general to not consolidate his gains after winning a battle, or to fail to clarify the political situation. It will lead to disaster 몬waste and general stagnation몭 멪 in other words, disaster.
After winning a battle, it몭s crucial to win the political battle. Otherwise, the 몬victory몭 you just won on the battlefield will turn into a disaster. Active battlegrounds are quagmires, and when the fighting몭s done they become black holes, sucking up your money and your troops몭 stamina. If you stay there, you몭re setting yourself up for catastrophe.
A classic example of 몬waste and general stagnation몭 is the Wu invasion of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period. Sun Tzu himself was involved in the war. King Helu of Wu came to power by killing King Liao and seizing the throne. He was an enthusiastic reformer, and his army grew stronger. He went head to head with the state of Chu, aiming to become the dominant power among the various Chinese states. In the third year of his reign, he invaded Chu together with the strategists Wu Zixu, Bo Pi and Sun Tzu. They won a great victory, and King Helu want to push on immediately and capture the city of Ying, capital of Chu. But, Sun Tzu told him that the people were worn out, and the time was not right to attack Ying. They should wait for an opportunity. Only when Sun Tzu spoke out did King Helu let go of his burning desire to move on Ying immediately.
Wu scored two more major victories over Chu, once in the fourth year of King Helu몭s reign and again during the sixth year. Between these campaigns, Wu also defeated the state of Yue during the fifth year of the king몭s reign. By the ninth year of his reign, King Helu could no longer hold himself back. He went for advice to Wu Zixu and Sun Tzu: 몮You both were against invading Ying all those years back. Well, what about now?몯 Wu Zixu and Sun Tzu were unanimous: if alliances with the states of Tang and Cai could be secured, an invasion of Ying could go ahead. The Wu army once again invaded Chu, and this time took the city of Ying in one fell swoop. The King of Chu fled his country, and this became the first example of a state capturing the capital city of another major state during the Spring and Autumn period.
The war between Wu and Chu lasted nine years. What was the prevailing state of affairs? Waste and general stagnation. Why? Because the sole focus was war; nobody was thinking about politics. Not only did King Helu fail to take any political action or 몬cultivate the spirit of enterprise몭 after occupying Chu, he didn몭t even have a coherent approach to politics in his own country. While he wallowed in waste and stagnation in the city of Ying, the leaders of Yue saw their chance and invaded Wu. Meanwhile, the remaining Chu forces requested assistance from the state of Qin, whose leaders sent their army to attack the Wu forces. Fighting a war on two fronts, the Wu forces were defeated in their battles against both the Qin and the Yue forces. Helu몭s younger brother, Fugai, saw how Helu was idling away his time in Ying, with no intention of returning to Wu, so he went back alone and proclaimed himself the new king.
With the country in chaos, Helu rushed back from the city of Ying with his army to attack Fugai, which allowed the Chu forces to retake the now empty city of Ying. Fugai, coming under attack from his older brother, fled and surrendered to the Chu authorities.
After years of war, Helu had nothing to show for it. Despite that, he invaded Chu again the very next year and won another big victory.
Helu몭s army was always a force to be reckoned with. Its power reverberated across the lands of China. However, nothing lasts forever. In the 19th year of King Helu몭s reign he suffered a serious injury while fighting against Yue forces, and later died of his wounds. He was succeeded by his son, Fuchai. When Helu was on his deathbed, he told Fuchai to never forget the man who killed his father 멪 King Gou Jian of Yue. 
The story of Fuchai and Gou Jian is well known among Chinese people. It ends with Fuchai and his country being destroyed by Gou Jian, making Wu one of the first major states during the Spring and Autumn period to be tossed into the dustbin of history.
몮Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise.몯 The most classic example of this is the state of Wu, from the same time period as Sun Tzu몭s life. In ancient China, there was the idea that 몬He who wins many victories is doomed.몭 If you win 100 battles, you몭re going to die. Isn몭t that a strange idea? This saying actually originated as a comment on the state of Wu.
Marquess Wen of Wei once said to Li Ke: 몮Why was the state of Wu destroyed?몯 Li Ke replied: 몮Because Wu fought many battles and won many victories.몯 Marquess Wen said: 몮It is a blessing for a country to fight many battles and win many victories. So why was the state of Wu defeated?몯 Li Ke told him: 몮Many battles make the people poor; many victories make the lord arrogant. The state of Wu was destroyed because an arrogant lord ruled over an impoverished people.몯
The strategist Wu Qi had a similar understanding:
몮Attacking and winning is easy, maintaining one몭s victorious position is difficult. Hence it is said: 몬Among all the warring states of the world, those who win five victories suffer great catastrophe, those who win four victories face many problems, those who win three victories become regional hegemons, those who win two victories become king, those who win one victory become Emperor.몭 Hence, rare are those states who conquer the world by winning many victories, yet many such states suffer destruction.몯
Xiang Yu fought and won dozens of battles, while his rival Liu Bang only won a single battle, at Gaixia.
Attacking and winning is easy; maintaining one몭s victorious position is difficult. This is the case today for the United States. Invading Iraq was as easy as cutting up a rotten tree, but holding onto victory is another story. The US has been unable to hold its position in Iraq, in Libya, and indeed anywhere else. In Iraq, America fell into 몬waste and general stagnation.몭 Obama was[bd45][TT46] unwilling to stay mired in this state because it would only lead to more losses. But if you have a girlfriend, you can몭t just break off your relationship the moment you feel like it, and you certainly can몭t undo the invasion of a foreign country the moment you feel like it. These conflicts started with chaotic invasions and ended with the United States running away.
Victory isn몭t easy!

몮Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.몯

So, a wise ruler thinks through these things very carefully, and exceptional generals are obligated to do their research thoroughly. If there몭s no benefit to be gained, don몭t take action. Don몭t raise an army if you can몭t win, and don몭t fight unless the situation demands it. Rulers can몭t go on the warpath just because they몭re angry, nor can generals start a battle merely because they몭re enraged. Action should only be taken if there몭s some benefit to be gained for the country, and war should be stopped the moment it becomes unbeneficial for the country. Joy can be restored after an episode of anger, but a destroyed country cannot be revived, and the dead cannot be brought back to life. A wise ruler has to be cautious and a good general has to stay vigilant.
This is the only way to keep your country safe and your army intact!


Appendix: Complete text of Attacking by Fire

Sun Tzu said: 몮There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is to burn stores; the third is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn depots; the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst enemy units. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments: (1) When fire breaks out inside the enemy몭s camp, respond at once with an attack from without; (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy몭s soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack; (3) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favourable moment; (4) When you start a fire, be to windward of it 멪 do not attack from the leeward; (5) A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, and a watch kept for the proper days. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack show strength. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result is waste and general stagnation. Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by contentment. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful and the good general full of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.몯


Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies

Giving money to other people isn몭t the same as stating their value; It몭s stating your own value

Extract from the original text:
몮Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor. Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy몭s condition, simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation. Knowledge of the enemy몭s dispositions can only be obtained from other men.몯

Analysis:
Cao Cao몭s first comment is about 몬the use of spies.몭 몮Those engaged in warfare,몯 he wrote, 몮must use spies in order to learn the actual situation of the enemy.몯

몮Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.몯

Cao Cao comments: 몮In ancient times, eight households formed one lin. In each lin, one household would contribute soldiers for the army, and the remaining seven would work in supporting roles. This passage says than when an army of 100,000 soldiers is raised, 700,000 households will be left unable to farm their fields.몯
Why did one lin consist of eight households? Du Mu comments: 몮In ancient times, the amount of land one man could farm was called one qing. In any area of nine qing, a well would be dug and dwellings erected in the center-most qing. Eight households would live and farm there, and this area was called a well field. This passage says that 700,000 households will suffer exhaustion on the roads while transporting supplies.몯
The well field that Du Mu mentions is not quite the same as the 몬well field system몭 that Chinese middle school pupils learn about in history class. In history textbooks, the well field system is explained as being a way of dividing land into sets of nine squares, organized in a grid. The size of each square was 100 mu, and the eight squares along the perimeter of the grid were privately owned and farmed by individual families 멪 one per household. The central square was common land. The eight families had to finish working the common land before they could start farming their own private squares. The harvest from the private squares was kept by the families, while the harvest from the common land went to the state. But 몬the state몭 back then wasn몭t the same as now. It didn몭t refer to the whole country, but to noble houses like those of Duke Mu of Qin and Duke Xiang of Song.
But what몭s the difference between this and what Du Mu said? According to Du Mu, the center-most square wasn몭t common land, but comprised the village where the eight families had their houses, their well, and other communal facilities.
There몭s no way to verify whether the well field system of the Zhou dynasty consisted of private fields surrounding one common field. Personally, I have my doubts. For example, the idea of one common field where everyone works together is similar to the People몭s Communes of the collective agriculture era, beginning in the 1950s. In this system, it몭s difficult to monitor and control how much work and effort each person is contributing. Also, why should the harvest from the central common field go to the state? What if there몭s a good harvest for the private fields, but a poor harvest for the common field? It몭s vastly better to just collect tax from each family.
That몭s why I tend to think that the well field system wasn몭t just about drawing up a nine-square grid (in the shape of the character for 몬well,몭 뱖[bd47]). I agree with Du Mu몭s description 멪 farmland around the perimeter with a well and village in the middle.
Eight families in one well field; one family provides soldiers, the remaining seven provide labor and help transporting supplies. So, in total, an army of 100,000 soldiers actually requires the labor of 700,000 families. This is a massive expense.
The expense of mounting a war was covered in great detail in Chapter Two, Waging War. Here, Sun Tzu emphasizes it once more, showing that his value system involves being extremely cautious in matters involving expenses of war and the cost of victory. This is quite different for some people today, who say 몬no matter the cost몭 without thinking. Deng Xiaoping put it succinctly when he said: 몮People say so many empty words.몯 Everything has a cost. The most important calculation to make, whenever you want to do something, is to estimate the cost. If there몭s a potential profit, go ahead. If not, quit while you몭re ahead.

몮Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy몭s condition, simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory.몯

What a resource-intensive thing war is! Armies really do spend years lined up opposite one another, all for the sake of a single day, the day of victory! If you accept the massive expense of keeping an army in the field day after day, yet remain clueless about what몭s going on in the enemy camp just because you can몭t bring yourself to spend money on spies, you are a supremely irresponsible 멪 and even inhumane 멪 general. You몭re not a pillar of your country, and you몭re definitely not a 몬master of victory.몭
Sun Tzu put 몬the height of inhumanity몭 at the top of the list of negative adjectives that describe such behavior, because a general who acts in this way shows disregard for the good of his country and his people. The core values in The Art of War are 몬use benevolence몭 and 몬take whatever action the situation calls for.몭 For any student, it몭s necessary to remember that benevolence and humanity come first, and 몬taking whatever action the situation calls for몭 comes last. Too often, people think that the art of war is essentially about doing whatever is necessary, including using underhanded tricks. If that몭s your interpretation, you몭ll never really understand the art of war.
During the Chu-Han Contention, nobody was more willing to spend money than Liu Bang, and nobody was more reluctant to spend money than Xiang Yu. As the war reached its most intense phase, Xiang Yu trapped Liu Bang behind the walls of Xingyang city. Liu Bang spent a year unable to free himself and totally cut off from reinforcement and supplies. But his advisor, Chen Ping, had a plan 멪 he told Liu Bang to take 40,000 jin of gold from his reserves and bribe some of the Chu generals. The idea was to spread division among the Chu ranks and create distance between Xiang Yu and his general, Zhong Limei, while also removing General Fan Zeng from Xiang Yu몭s inner circle. In the end, by making these strategic expenditures, Liu Bang was able to break out from Xiang Yu몭s siege.
Years later, when Liu Bang was surrounded by the Xiongyu chieftain Modun몭s forces at Baideng, Chen Ping once again came forward with a plan: to offer a large bribe to Modun몭s wife and have her persuade Modun to let Liu Bang go.
Xiang Yu and Liu Bang were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to the value they attached to spending money. Xiang Yu had the ability to truly love his people, as if they were his own children, but he had even greater love for the people몭s money. Han Xin gives us some particularly vivid musings about Xiang Yu: 몮When King Xiang saw his people he bestowed compassion, respect and love; he spoke softly to them and whenever one of his people fell ill he would weep and sob and feed them with his own food. When a subject performed some good deed meriting reward of noble title, he would carve an official seal to mark the ennoblement, yet feel loathe to give it to his subject. This is what is known as 몬the benevolence of a woman.몭몯
If you have a problem that can be dealt with by just spending money, that몭s always the lowest-cost solution. If you spend more money on spies than on anything else, it몭s also the most cost-saving investment you could make. Zhang Yu comments: 몮When armies spend long periods of time facing one another in the field and 700,000 households exhaust their wealth and their strength, if the leader has no care for these expenses and yet begrudges the cost of dispensing rewards and noble titles to spies who uncover information about the enemy, then this is the height of inhumanity.몯
This idea seems simple, when you read it in a book. But, in reality, it몭s extremely difficult to apply it in your work process. In fact, it몭s the hardest part of all. What makes it so difficult? The problem is human nature. Specifically, four types of mentality get in the way:
Mentality type one: You몭ve gotten used to spending large sums of money on certain expenses without thinking about it, but any additional small expenses that aren몭t in your budget make you feel extremely uneasy, to the point that you몭re completely unable to spend these small sums.
For example, if you몭re spending money every day on 700,000 households, perhaps one piece of gold per household, that adds up to 700,000 pieces of gold per day. And yet, you don몭t mentally register this expense. It seems like a river 멪 it몭s just there, and it just keeps flowing. But, if you몭re called upon to spend an extra 50,000 per day, you won몭t even consider doing it.
Mentality type two: You keep track of other people몭s money, but not your own.
You don몭t keep track of your own expenses, and you don몭t even know how much money you몭re spending every day on the 700,000 men working for you. But, you do keep a close eye on other people몭s money. When dealing with people you work with, you have thoughts like: 몬So, you몭re really asking for this much money? Do you really have a good reason for asking me for this much? Are you really worth that much to me? Does it match the value you몭ve given me?몭 You don몭t take it well when people ask for money. You feel resentful and reluctant, and you몭d rather make things harder for yourself than let others take advantage of you financially. Xiang Yu is a classic example of this mentality. In his mind, his followers were freeloaders profiting from his military success, and he thought they had no right to want rewards from him.
There몭s one cure for this mentality: understand that giving other people money doesn몭t mean you몭re making a statement about their value 멪 it몭s actually a statement about your own value. You need to give people a lot of money not because they몭re extremely valuable, but because you몭re extremely valuable, and the things you몭re trying to accomplish are extremely valuable.
It몭s like a large corporation that spends a billion dollars to acquire a start-up company, even if the acquisition target has only been running for a year or less and may not even be generating income. Is the start-up really worth a billion dollars? The deal would instantly make the start-up founder richer than the CEO of the corporation that몭s acquiring it. However, if the corporation doesn몭t buy the start-up today, tomorrow it might become a competitor and completely overturn your whole market. From that perspective, a billion dollars suddenly seems like a bargain!
Mentality type three: How do I know it몭s the right move to give that person the money? It몭s possible that I몭ll ultimately realize I gave away my money for something that has no value, or that I gave it to the wrong person entirely!
For example, imagine giving an enemy general a sum of money as a bribe, but after taking your payoff he still refuses to turn against his commander. In your attempt to sow division among the enemy, you몭ve actually played into your opponent몭s hands and caused division in your own organization. So, hasn몭t the money you spent actually made your situation worse?
This is an extremely common mentality. It seems to be rational, but in fact it몭s a dead end. You should have started off by considering the possibility that spending the money might lead you into a trap. If there were 100% certainty that you could solve your problem by spending money, it would be too easy! The world몭s not that simple.
Spending money is sometimes just a way of creating or eliminating certain possible outcomes. There몭s never a guaranteed outcome. Consider again the example of the big corporation acquiring the small start-up. There몭s every chance that if the corporation didn몭t acquire it, the new business would never take off and would never become a competitive threat. Or, a similar start-up might spring up the day after the first one had been acquired. In both cases, there몭s nothing to be done about it, because the start-up is simply worth too much money.
Mentality type four: I only want to spend my money where it really counts.
There몭s an especially effective antidote for this mentality: to believe that the only way to 몬spend money where it really counts몭 is to spend on things that you don몭t want to spend money on.
The only way to increase the odds of spending money where it counts is to spread your spending over a wide enough area. If you succeed in spending just one percent of your money where it counts 멪 on the cutting edge of your operations 멪it will yield a thousand-fold in return. The principle is exactly the same as in investing. Putting long-term work into large-scale angel investing is an integral part of business intelligence-gathering operations.
If you want to spend all of your money 몬where it really counts,몭 you몭re deluding yourself. It will never happen.

몮Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.몯

Mei Yaochen comments: 몮The lord does not move recklessly. When he moves, he is certain of vanquishing the foe. The general does not act negligently in the pursuit of achievements, and so he is sure to achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men. What makes these things possible? Foreknowledge of the enemy몭s situation.몯
A famous general of the Northern Zhou dynasty (557-581 CE), Cavalry General-in-Chief Wei Xiaokuan, led the defence of Yubi Fortress. His greatest skill was keeping the people he worked with happy, and he also knew how to make good use of spies. All of the agents he sent to spy on the state of Northern Qi knew how to execute commands and complete tasks to the best of their ability. There were also subjects of Northern Qi who took his money and passed on information, which helped keep the Northern Zhou fully informed on the latest happenings in Northern Qi. Wei Xiaokuan sent one of his men, a high-ranking general named Xu Pen, to take command of the garrison in a key city. Wei Xiaokuan trusted this man completely, but to his surprise Xu Pen surrendered himself and the city he was responsible for to the Northern Qi authorities. Wei Xiaokuan was enraged, and sent an agent to assassinate Xu Pen. The assassin soon returned, carrying Xu Pen몭s head. Clearly, Wei Xiaokuan had the ability to use spies to accomplish anything his heart desired.

몮Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits멞몯

If you want to understand what몭s going on, you mustn몭t use divination or ask ghosts and spirits to help you.

몮멞 it cannot be obtained inductively from experience멞몯

You can몭t make assumptions by drawing on parallels between the current situation and your past experiences.
Du Mu comments: 몮This is about analogy. This passage says that you cannot seek to compare different situations using analogy.몯 This is an important comment, with a lot of information to unpack.
Throughout Chinese history, analogies have always been one of the favorite tools of political advisors and lobbyists, and the same is true today in commercial advertising. For example, in one toothpaste advertisement, an analogy is made between winter snow covering trees in a white coat and the ability of toothpaste to prevent tooth decay. But, what몭s the connection between these two things? Actually, there몭s no connection at all. Can the analogy prove that this brand of toothpaste can prevent tooth decay? Not in the slightest. However, the connection seems reasonable on the surface, and the visual impact of the image makes a strong impression. Sparkling, white teeth appear to be clean, healthy and strong. This is the influence analogies can have on people몭s thinking.
So, when the time comes for us to make a major decision, it몭s necessary to cleanse yourself of the influence of analogy-based thinking. In meetings, speak with precision and discuss each agenda item only in terms of its own merits. Don몭t allow anyone to use analogies, because they can stealthily divert the conversation and make it about something else entirely. They can make people deceive themselves and pass the deception on to others.

몮멞 nor by any deductive calculation.몯

This is another line that has been interpreted in different ways.
Cao Cao comments: 몮It cannot be gauged by reference to other things.몯 You can몭t use the normal way of things, or patterns you have observed from your own experience, to make predictions about what will happen, because exceptions to any rule are always possible.
In fact, Cao Cao got this one wrong in his own career. During the Battle of Red Cliffs, he deployed his boats in a long, linked-up line. When his men reminded him to take precautions, in case the enemy attacked with fire, he gauged the situation 몬with reference to other things몭 멪 he said that because it was winter the wind wouldn몭t blow from the southeast. In the end, though, that몭s exactly what happened.
Li Quan comments: 몮Here, 몬calculation몭 refers to counting and measuring. This passage could be referring to counting and measuring anything, including length, width, distance and size. People몭s emotions are fickle, and it is impossible to gain knowledge from counting and measuring.몯
The later commentators all said more or less the same thing, but none of them asked the most crucial question.  Namely, what is 몬counting and measuring?몭
Later scholars offer an explanation, suggesting that 몬counting and measuring몭 is about measuring the movements (positions) of the sun, moon and stars. Their explanation for this line is that you can몭t use the positions of celestial bodies to learn about the enemy몭s situation. In the classic novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, we often see Zhuge Liang spending his nights stargazing and trying to calculate whether the heavens are showing him omens fair or ill. But, Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War tells us, this is not reliable.
So, the ancient leaders understood all of this, and none of them indulged in superstition. They recognized that 몬Knowledge of the enemy몭s dispositions can only be obtained from other men.몭 In other words, the only way to gain this knowledge is to have eyes and ears on the ground.
When you read and study, you need to ground yourself in the correct values. From the explanations we몭ve seen about the meaning of 몬deductive calculations,몭 we know there are various ways to understand it. There몭s making deductions based on 몬the normal way of things,몭 counting and measuring data, and reading the stars. But which one is right? It몭s actually not important which one is 몬right.몭 Each provides a different perspective from which to look at problems, and each of these perspectives is extremely valuable 멪 they lead us to think and reflect, and through them we can learn many new things.
Many people look for the answer to this question by analyzing, critiquing and cross-referencing other ancient texts. Yet, all such attempts can only unearth different usages for the word translated as 몬deductive calculation,몭 which they then insert into this passage of The Art of War. You can몭t say that the old writers were wrong, and presume to come up with a new 몬correct answer.몭 The Ming dynasty philosopher Wang Yangming addressed precisely this problem. He said that reading and studying are about what you can get out of them, not about trying to find the 몬right answer몭 by digging through reams of ancient writings.


Five ways to use spies (parts one, two, and three): All doubts ultimately are doubts you have about yourself

Extract from the original text:
몮Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local spies; (2) Inward spies; (3) Converted spies; (4) Doomed spies; (5) Surviving spies. When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called 몬divine manipulation of the threads.몭 It is the sovereign몭s most precious faculty. Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district. Having inward spies means making use of the enemy몭s own officials. Having converted spies means getting hold of the enemy몭s spies and using them for our own purposes. Having doomed spies refers to doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy. Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy몭s camp.몯

Analysis:
몮Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local spies; (2) Inward spies; (3) Converted spies; (4) Doomed spies; (5) Surviving spies. When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called 몬divine manipulation of the threads.몭 It is the sovereign몭s most precious faculty.몯
When you use these five types of spies simultaneously, the enemy is unable to work out how information is leaking out.

몮Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district.몯

Our 11 commentators몭 remarks about 몬inhabitants of a district몭 are simple. They don몭t go out of their way to explain what it means 멪 it just means local people in the enemy몭s country.
Du Mu comments: 몮Village people of the enemy몭s country.몯
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Avail yourself of the country몭s people and make use of them by providing them with benefits.몯
Jia Lin comments: 몮Interpret 몬local spies몭 as 몬enemy villagers.몭몯
However, General Guo Huaruo has his own, differing explanation. He says that the word translated here as 몬local몭 (xiang) had different meaning in the ancient Chinese language of the Spring and Autumn period. According to General Guo, it refers to the enemy몭s local government officials and noblemen. In the state of Qi, such people were referred to as xiang liangren, and in the state of Song they were called xiang zheng. According to a subchapter in The Rites of Zhou, entitled Xiang Dafu, those who held the official rank of 몬xiang dafu몭 were positioned between the Minister of Education and the Rural Officer.
General Guo몭s explanation makes an important contribution. He asserted that for a spy to be capable of producing valuable intelligence, they have to have a certain level of status and involvement in local affairs.
A good example of someone who knew how to use local spies is Zu Ti, well known in China for his strong work ethic. Zu Ti came from a high-status northern family, but then the Uprising of the Five Barbarians turned the Chinese world upside down. The Han Chinese people of northern China fled south, the Western Jin dynasty ended, and the Eastern Jin dynasty took its place. Zu Ti was possessed by a burning desire to retake the Central Plain from the barbarians. He was optimistic by nature, much more interested in justice and righteousness than the details of finance. He was also a hard worker, devoted both to academic studies and military training, and an accomplished warrior and thinker. Zu TI was brave, wise and inspired trust in all around him.
Zu Ti loved his men, and in return his men pledged their lives to him. There was no 몬principal몭 he wasn몭t willing to set aside for the sake of his soldiers. His army was sizeable, and included no shortage of rogues and thieves. When famine broke out in Yang Prefecture, some soldiers went around robbing rich families, and when they were occasionally arrested by local authorities, Zu Ti used his local connections to secure their release. Not only did he not criticize them, he would even say things like: 몮How about we go down to Nantang and do a heist together?몯 These actions ensured that every soldier in the land thought their lives would be complete if only they could serve under Zu Ti.
Leaders like Zu Ti, who form close, even brotherly, bonds with their men and are able to make their soldiers absolutely committed to them, are only suited to being regional strongmen. They can never become Emperor, or even a major court minister or advisor. If an Emperor or a prime minister treated the men under their command as their own brothers, willing to cover for their illegal behavior and sloppy discipline 멪 as long as they do whatever is asked of them and ask no questions 멪 they몭re indulging in corruption in exchange for loyalty. They are in effect governing their country using corruption, and the country will fall. A good example of this is Emperor Wu of Liang. 
Zu Ti eventually became a target of the court몭s jealousy and suspicion, and later died in a cloud of anger and resentment. Is it any wonder that a lawless maverick like Zu Ti would attract the enmity of others?
Looking back for a moment at how Zu Ti made use of 몬local spies,몭 he treated them the same way as his own men, like they were his sworn brothers.  His attitude was that, as long as you몭re with me, I몭ll protect you no matter what. While Zu Ti was serving as Governor of Yu Prefecture, he shared a border with Shi Le of the Later Zhao dynasty. China was experiencing a chaotic period at the time, and in the borderlands of the Jin and Zhao states (in modern-day Henan Province), the local strongmen were focused only on protecting their own necks. The border fort commanders all had sons living in Zhao captivity as hostages, so Zu Ti made exceptions for them and let them maintain good relations on both sides of the border. He treated them with special courtesy and got them to provide him with intelligence from contacts in Later Zhao. Occasionally, he would launch a pretend attack against one of the Jin forts to show the Later Zhao authorities that the garrisons had nothing to do with him. Because of this, the fort commanders felt extremely grateful to Zu Ti, so they kept him up to date on all the latest happenings across the border, in the lands of Later Zhao. This was a major factor in Zu Ti몭s success in retaking large swathes of land in the Henan area.

몮Having inward spies means making use of the enemy몭s own officials.몯

Du Mu wrote about seven types of people, and the categories he came up with can be applied to 몬inward spies.몭 Here are his descriptions of the types of officials who might be co-opted:
1. Among enemy officials, there are capable men who have lost their posts.
2. There are those who have made mistakes and been punished.
3. There are those who harbor proclivities or lust after wealth.
4. There are those who are wasting away in lowly positions.
5. There are those who are unable to secure appointments as envoys.
6. There are those who, having suffered defeat and loss, develop their talents and skills.
There are deceptive turncoats who habitually act as double agents.7. 
Du Mu comments: 몮You may secretly approach all of these types of officials and make enquiries. Give them generous presents of gold and silks to form ties with them. In order to acquire intelligence from their country, and investigate any schemes they may be plotting against you, make repeated enquiries about their lord, and the ministers of their country, and spread disharmony in their country.몯
You can find all kinds of people among enemy officials: talented men who have made mistakes and whose career is in jeopardy as a result; people who몭ve been punished and feel resentful; those whose father was punished and as a result of this face roadblocks in their own career. There will be those who are particularly fond of their wives or concubines, or who have some other 몬special interest,몭 and who are also hungry for money. Some will be unsatisfied with their station in life; some feel blocked from realizing their potential; others want their own side to lose because they think it몭s the only way they몭ll get opportunities. And, there are individuals who are constantly changing sides. All of these types of men can be turned into 몬inward spies.몭
However, if you decide to use 몬inward spies,몭 understand that the enemy will try to put on shows for you. For example, when Zhou Yu attacked Huang Gai, he only did it so that Cao Cao would see him doing it. It made Cao Cao think that Huang Gai would be filled with hate and willing to surrender to him; that his defenses would be lowered. In the end, this led to Cao Cao몭s ships being burned by Huang Gai at Red Cliffs.
Sun Tzu himself once fell prey to enemies taking advantage of some of his officials몭 fondness for money and other interests to bribe them. Fuchai of Wu had surrounded Gou Jian of Yue and 5,000 exhausted Yue troops, remnants of a defeated army, at Huiji Mountain. Yue몭s destruction seemed imminent. At the time, there were three high-ranking advisors in King Fuchai몭s entourage: Wu Zixu, Sun Tzu and Bo Pi. Gou Jian sent a messenger to tell King Fuchai that he wanted to surrender, but Wu Zixu urged Fuchai not to give Gou Jian any chances. He advised destroying Yue outright. Meanwhile, Gou Jian sent a man named Wen Zhong to bribe Bo Pi with gold and beautiful women, and to tell him that, despite appearances suggesting that Yue was surrendering to King Fuchai, the real surrender was actually being offered to him, Bo Pi. Wen Zhong also told Bo Pi that, from then on, any time gold, silks or women were sent to the Wu king, Bo Pi would get the first pick. The wealth of Yue was to be at Bo Pi몭s disposal. This convinced Bo Pi to throw all his strength into assisting Yue.
There are certain skills that dishonest advisors have and loyal advisors don몭t. The King of Wu ignored Wu Zixu몭s and Sun Tzu몭s counsel on this matter. He gave his ear exclusively to Bo Pi. Later, Bo Pi worked together with Gou Jian to murder Wu Zixu, despite the favor Wu Zixu had done Bo Pi by recommending him to the King of Wu when Bo Pi had fallen on hard times. The reason Gou Jian later had the nerve to deliver himself as a hostage to the Kingdom of Wu, in a bid to lull Fuchai into a false sense of security, was to a large extent because he had Bo Pi몭s protection. Again, it was Bo Pi who later persuaded Fuchai to release Gou Jian and give him safe passage back home to Yue. And, it was through Bo Pi that Gou Jian sent two famously beautiful women, Xi Shi and Zheng Dan, as gifts to Fuchai. It was also Bo Pi who caused Fuchai to squander his people몭s energy and his kingdom몭s riches by not only suggesting that he rebuild the Gusu Tower, but also arranging for the finest Yue timber to be made available for the job.
Gou Jian made full use of spies, and he used almost the entire contents of The Art of War.  He embraced the notion that 몬all warfare is based on deception몭 in Chapter One, Calculations, through to the concepts of 몬make yourself weak to make the enemy arrogant멞 if he is taking his ease give him no rest멞 and if his forces are united, separate them.몭 Sun Tzu was left with no moves to make; all he could do was watch wide-eyed as the kingdom of Wu was destroyed.
Spies were also a factor in LI Shimin몭s defeat of Dou Jiande.
Li Shimin had surrounded Wang Shichong and Dou Jiande was on the move, intending to rescue Wang. Li Shimin seized the initiative by taking Hulao Pass, and Dou Jiande was unable to break through Li몭s position. Each time Dou attacked the pass, Li몭s soldiers came charging out to beat them back. Dou몭s forces suffered many casualties. Li Shimin weak spot was his fear that Dou Jiande would refuse to fight him at Hulao Pass and instead turn around and attack him from the rear. Doesn몭t The Art of War talk precisely about this? Sun Tzu made it clear that when the enemy has control of 몬contentious ground,몭 don몭t attack. Instead, you should lead your army away and attack places and things that are important to your opponent, which he몭s bound to defend. Draw the enemy out and then ambush him on the road. So what if Li had control of Hulao Pass? Dou should have just left him to it.
This is clearly a simple principle. There were undoubtedly people in Dou Jiande몭s camp who were aware of it. Indeed, an advisor named Ling Jing told Dou Jiande: 몮We should cross the Yellow River with the entire army and move north, attack and seize Heyang in Huai Prefecture, and place a general in charge of defending the city. Then, you should lead the bulk of your forces and, with drums beating and battle flags raised, cross through the Taihang Mountains and move into Shangdang County. But this will be a ruse, and you will hide your true intention. You need not trouble yourself by actually fighting battles. Accelerate the pace of your army몭s march, make for Hukou Pass and, taking Pu Jin by surprise and harassing his forces, seize the land to the east of the river. This is the best strategy, and it offers three benefits: first, by pivoting your army to a position undefended by the enemy, your forces cannot lose; second, by expanding the territory under your control you can recruit more soldiers; and third, the enemy Tang army will then, of its own accord, lift its siege of Wang Shichong몭s position.몯
Ling Jing몭s plan was a textbook application of standard operating procedures for 몬contentious ground,몭 and it also embodied the strategy of relieving a besieged ally by attacking the besiegers in a different location. There몭s nothing particularly cunning about this plan 멪 it was straight from the playbook. Dou Jiande thought this approach made sense, and he initially planned to use it. If he had, though, Li Shimin would have been in big trouble.
But what happened next? Who gave Li Shimin a helping hand? It was Wang Shichong himself. Besieged and desperate, Wang Shichong saw Dou Jiande moving his army away, and the city of Luoyang fell. Wang몭s senior emissary, Sun Anshi, secretly sent gold, silver and pearls to various generals in Dou Jiande몭s army and asked them to persuade Dou not to leave. They said to Dou: 몮Ling Jing is nothing but a student of books, how can you seriously consider his opinions about matters of war?몯
Dou Jiande folded. How could the opinion of a 몬student of books몭 hold up against so many senior generals? So, Dou changed his plan. This decision ultimately ruined him. He was run ragged at Hulao Pass by Li Shimin, captured and sent to Chang몭an, where he was beheaded.
Dou몭s generals had willingly served as agents for Wang Shichong, and they ended up hurting themselves, Dou Jiande and Wang Shichong.
This is the pain of being a leader. Everyone has advice, but while some are loyal servants to their country, others conceal ulterior motives behind their words: desire for power and material gain. How are you supposed to tell the difference? Even the people giving advice can몭t tell! In the case of Dou Jiande, Ling Jing had loyalty and patriotism in his heart, and he spoke plainly and objectively. Meanwhile, the senior generals were in the pockets of Wang Shichong. However, when they spoke to Dou Jiande on behalf of Wang Shichong, they spoke with conviction and strength; in their minds, they didn몭t say what they said only because of the money. So, what was the other reason? It몭s part of the human condition, and as universal now as it always has been 멪 people fool themselves and then fool others. Once the generals believed what they had to say was right and fair, they assured themselves that reason was on their side. They argued that there was no reason to run away from LI Shimin몭s puny force of 3,500 men when Dou commanded an army of 100,000. Yet, in their wisdom they failed to recognize just how brutal and dangerous war truly is.
There are simply too many examples of the use of spies in war. You couldn몭t fit all of them into a single book, even if you wrote about nothing else. It몭s not at all true that all spies always intend to betray their country. In many cases, they aren몭t aware of just how much harm their lies can do. They몭re simply jealous of other, more talented men, and they want to thwart them and ruin their chances of being credited for their national service. Or, they want to feel that their existence has meaning by expressing by their own unique way of seeing a situation. In doing so, they몭re dragged down into murky depths by their country몭s enemies.
People like to sigh over kings and lords who are led astray by the words of petty, immoral men. Yet, such men are not all bad people like Bo Pi was. More often than not, they몭re simply people operating without much understanding of the world. They might believe themselves to be highly loyal to their lord, and their lord also might believe them to be loyal. This is precisely the type of person who is most easily turned into a spy or an agent, because they remain unaware that they몭re serving as a spy. They don몭t understand why the person grooming them to be a spy is giving them gifts, or what that person몭s goal is. These people who have limited vision and understanding, and who become spies, are even more destructive to their country than those who are truly bad! This is because kings and lords don몭t put up any defenses against these kinds of people, in the belief that they don몭t have it in their hearts to do anything bad.
During the infamous Feast at Hongmen, the key factor that allowed Liu Bang to escape was that he had bought off Xiang Yu몭s uncle, Xiang Bo. Did Xiang Bo believe he was doing anything to hurt Xiang Yu? No, he didn몭t. Did Xiang Bo know that, through his actions, he was serving as Liu Bang몭s agent? No. He was just a well-meaning fellow, and he certainly had no malice in him. It never would have occurred to Xiang Yu that he needed to protect himself against Xiang Bo. And yet, Xiang Bo had agreed to marry one of his family members to one of Liu Bang몭s family. As such, before the Feast at Hongmen, Xiang Bo was already kin with Liu Bang.
This is why the state cannot use people who are supposedly of 몬good morals,몭 but who lack talent. Issues that effect an entire country can only be understood by people who have a certain amount of ability 멪 they몭re the only ones who belong in high-level discussions of national importance. Anyway, true morality always comes as a package with talent and ability, because morality is the highest form of insight and understanding. There몭s no such thing as people who are virtuous but untalented. Talent is a precondition for virtue; it몭s impossible for a person with no talent to have moral power.
There몭s another common, and highly dangerous, situation: people who want others to fail so that they have a chance to 몬prove themselves.몭 Initially, everyone on your team might be loyal, patriotic servants of their country, but the moment the king decides to use Advisor A몭s strategy, and not Advisor B몭s, what happens? Will Advisor B want the plan to succeed, or will he want it to fail? In many cases, he몭ll want the plan to fail because then he몭ll have a chance to prove he was right. A certain percentage of advisors will end up serving as an enemy accomplice, precisely because of this.
Those who play turncoat and change sides often play both sides. When people regularly switch their allegiances, both sides want them for their own. However, neither side trusts them, and might cast them out at any moment. General Lu Bu, also known as 몬the slave of three surnames,몭 is a classic example of this. Where did the 몬three surnames몭 come from? His original surname was Lu, so that몭s one. Later, he showed his loyalty to the warlord Ding Yuan by ceremonially recognizing him as his father, making Ding his second surname. He was later bribed by Dong Zhuo, and killed Ding Yuan. He proclaimed that Dong Zhuo was his new father, and so Dong became his third surname. But, it didn몭t stop there. He later killed Dong Zhuo on behalf of Diaochan. So, when Lu Bu offered his fealty to Cao Cao, Cao Cao didn몭t dare trust him. Instead, he sentenced him to death.
It was the same story with Meng Da, another general of the Three Kingdoms period. He started off as a general for the kingdom of Shu but later switched his allegiance to Wei, before finally going back to Shu after being lured back by Zhuge Liang. It was part of Zhuge Liang몭s plan 멪 he leaked information that Meng Da was in contact with Shu leaders so that Wei general Sima Yi would find out, leaving Meng Da with no way back and no option except to work for Shu. Sima Yi knew what kind of man Meng Da was 멪 he knew that he liked to play both sides 멪 so he also wrote letters to him, tempting him to reconsider. Then, Sima Yi moved his army rapidly, and within eight days had arrived at Meng Da몭s city, where he defeated and executed him. Sima Yi managed to deal with the instability Meng Da had created and secure the city, all without taking any losses. Meanwhile, Zhuge Liang also made some small gains: he몭d eliminated one of Wei몭s generals, and he몭d also taken Sima Yi for a ride. And that몭s how Meng Da was cast aside.

몮Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy몭s spies and using them for our own purposes.몯

몬Converting spies몭 is about enticing enemy spies into working for you. Du Mu tells us there are two ways of enticing enemy spies: 몮If the enemy has spies sent to spy on me, you must know the situation beforehand. You can either entice them with lavish gifts or pretend you are unaware and furnish them with false information by way of contriving performances. Thus, the enemy몭s spies work for you.몯
Either lavish them with gifts to make them willing to work for you, or pretend you don몭t know what몭s going on, put on a show for them, and let them send back misleading information to their master.
During the Chu-Han Contention, Liu Bang managed to catch Xiang Yu using the strategy of 몬converting몭 enemy spies. Liu Bang had the idea to eliminate one of Xiang Yu몭s key men, and his honorary 몬father,몭 Fan Zeng. To achieve this, he first played the 몬inward spies몭 card, using his man Chen Ping to pay 40,000 liang of gold to generals under Xiang Yu몭s command. These generals then spread rumors that Fan Zeng, Zhong Li and other advisors were disgruntled about their supposedly inadequate compensation, and that they were plotting to team up with Liu Bang to destroy King Xiang Yu. It was true that Xiang Yu wasn몭t particularly generous when it came to handing out rewards, so although he didn몭t fully believe the rumors, they still lodged inside his mind. The groundwork was now laid. As we described earlier in the book, when an envoy sent by Xiang Yu arrived at the Han camp, Chen Ping initially greeted him like an honored guest, with all the trimmings, laying out good wine and plenty of meat. But, just as the envoy sat down and began to speak, Chen Ping put on a surprised expression and said: 몮What? You몭re Xiang Yu몭s man? Why did I think it was Fan Zeng who sent you?몯 Immediately, he ordered a servant to clear away the meat and the wine, and began treating the envoy much less respectfully. When the messenger returned to his camp to report, Xiang Yu was furious. He sent Fan Zeng away.
This story seems ridiculous, as if Xiang Yu was a toddler distracted by an adult making silly noises. And yet, somehow Xiang Yu fell for it. Why? One reason is that Chen Ping laid thorough groundwork by spreading rumors and influencing public opinion in Xiang Yu몭s camp. The second reason also had to do with Xiang Yu 멪 he wasn몭t generous enough to the people he worked with. This filled him with secret guilt; he felt uneasy and suspected that any of his men could betray him and go over to Liu Bang.
Suspicion always comes down to self-doubt.
Xiang Yu was by no means wrong to be suspicious. After all, his own uncle, Xiang Bo, had protected Liu Bang at the Feast of Hongmen. He몭d served as Liu Bang몭s 몬inward spy,몭 and it was he who persuaded Xiang Yu not to kill Liu Bang몭s father when the man was in his grasp. When Liu Bang became Emperor of all China, he allowed Xiang Bo to change his surname to Liu as a gift, and granted him the title of Duke of Sheyang.
Liu Bang also fell victim to the stratagem of 몬converting spies몭 at the hands of that bitter foe: Modun, chieftain of the Xiongnu.
Later, General Han Wangxin launched a rebellion against the Han Empire, joining forces with the Xiongnu. Liu Bang, in an attempt to wipe out the Xiongnu with a single blow, sent a dozen or more groups of trusted men to gather intelligence about the enemy몭s strengths and weaknesses. Modun hid his strongest men and horses and made sure the Han envoys saw only the oldest, weakest and most decrepit of his forces. So, the Han scouting parties reported that the Xiongnu were feeble, and that the time to strike was now. Only the lone voice of Lou Jing spoke up to say that this was a trick 멪 he saw that the Xiongnu were using the strategy of 몬converting spies몭 as a misdirection tactic. But, Liu Bang was hell-bent on fighting and flush with confidence. He cursed Lou Jing, saying that he was upsetting his men몭s focus, and locked him up with the threat that he몭d deal with him upon his triumphant return. 
In the end, Liu Bang was surrounded by 400,000 of Modun몭s men on the Baideng plateau, and barely escaped with his life. The only reason he managed to get a peace treaty and safe passage home was that Chen Ping came up with a plan to bribe Modun몭s favorite wife. To Liu Bang몭s credit, he immediately freed Lou Jing, made him Duke of Guannei, and granted him income in perpetuity from the taxation of 2,000 families. As for the dozen or so others who몭d said that it was safe to attack the Xiongnu, he executed them all.
No matter how deeply you read into The Art of War, and try to apply its lessons in the real world, you can never guarantee you won몭t be fooled, because you몭re always dealing with different situations and all kinds of different possibilities.


Five ways to use spies (parts four and five): 몬Doomed spies몭 and 몬Surviving spies몭

Extract from the original text:
몮Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy. Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy몭s camp.

Analysis:
몮Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.몯
It doesn몭t get much worse than being a 몬doomed spy.몭 When they몭re sent out on a mission, their own side has already sold them out. What defines a 몬doomed spy?몭 They몭re envoys or agents to whom you hand false information and order to pass it on to the enemy. They몭re not told that the information is false because, first of all, this makes it impossible for the mission to be compromised by an intelligence leak. Second, it makes them better able to win the enemy몭s trust. And third, of course, it means the thought never occurs to them that they should protect themselves. So, when the truth finally comes out for all to see, the unwitting spy is inevitably killed by the enemy. That몭s what makes him a 몬doomed spy.몭
Perhaps the most famous doomed spy was Li Shiqi. He worked for Liu Bang, and he was given the mission of going to the state of Qi and talking their leaders into surrendering. Blessed with a silver tongue, he did actually manage to persuade the King of Qi to give up. Holding his hand over his heart, he assured the king that if anything he몭d said was a lie, the king had his consent to boil him alive. The talks concluded with both the King of Qi and Li Shiqi enjoying a rowdy evening of drinking together. 
Things took a turn when Han Xin, unwilling to let a civilian with a big mouth like Li Shiqi overshadow everything he achieved on the battlefield, turned the tables. Han sent a force to attack Qi, which was totally unprepared. Now Li Shiqi was in a real pickle; he몭d become a doomed spy. Just before Han Xin destroyed Qi entirely, the King of Qi filled a massive cauldron with hot water and boiled Li Shiqi alive.
Another famous example of a doomed spy comes from the Spring and Autumn period. Duke Wu of Zheng had designs on invading the state of Hu. So what did he do? First, he set up a marriage alliance with Hu, arranging for his son to be married to a Hu woman. Then, at a meeting of his court, he told his advisors and ministers that he desired to expand his kingdom, and asked which direction would be the best for him to set his sights on. A senior official named Guan Qisi said: 몮The state of Hu is an appropriate target.몯 It was a good judgment call, but tragically, he didn몭t know that the reason his lord had asked this question was that he wanted a 몬doomed spy.몭 By being the first to put his hand up, Guan Qisi had unwittingly volunteered for the role.  Duke Wu flew into a rage, and said: 몮The people of Hu are our brothers, how dare you suggest we attack them?몯 He had Guan Qisi hauled from the court and executed.
Naturally, news of this episode soon reached the lord of Hu, and he felt full of gratitude! So, he let his guard down, and Duke Wu promptly raised an army and used it to utterly destroy Hu.
In a later era, there was a war between Northern Song and Western Xia. An agent was disguised as a monk, made to swallow a wax pellet and sent into Western Xia territory. He was caught by the local authorities and, after being interrogated, confessed that he had a wax pellet in his stomach. The pellet was taken out, and found to contain a secret message for a senior Western Xia strategist. The strategist was executed, and of course, the 몬monk몭 had to die, too. And so, yet another 몬doomed spy몭 met his cruel fate.

몮Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy몭s camp.몯

Doomed spies never come back from their missions. 몬Surviving spies몭 are their opposite 멪 they return from their missions alive, bearing information to report to their superiors.
Li Quan comments: 몮They are envoys who return.몯
According to Li Quan몭s interpretation, all diplomatic envoys and messengers are, in a broad sense, spies. They몭re spies who survive.
Du Mu comments: 몮They are messengers who return and deliver reports. When choosing men to be 몬surviving spies,몭 you must select those who are inwardly intelligent but outwardly foolish. They must appear weak but be mentally strong; they must be athletic and brave, unmoved by base concerns, and able to endure hunger, cold, dirtiness and humiliation.몯
During the Northern and Southern Dynasties period (420-589 CE), there was a war between Eastern Wei and Western Wei. Yuwen Tai of Western Wei sent an agent named Daxi Wu to spy on an Eastern Wei military camp at Gaohuan. He dressed in an enemy uniform and took three mounted soldiers with him. When evening fell, he was just a few hundred paces away from the enemy camp. He got down from his horse, listened, and learned the enemy몭s communication signals. Then, he got back on his horse and made his way around all of the nearby enemy camps, posing as a night sentry. He even whipped enemy soldiers who he found breaking the rules. And that몭s how Daxi Wu learned all the ins and outs of the enemy몭s situation, which he reported to Yuwen Tai upon his return home.


What special skill does a person like Chen Ping have? The skill of 몬Dividing up the pork몭

The skill of 몬dividing up the pork몭 is having the ability to weigh the interest of everyone involved, giving full play to each person몭s productivity, and coordinate the relationships between all involved. Being able to divide up the pork is something that political leaders and chief ministers must be able to do.

Extract from the original text:
몮Hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness. Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports. Oh, how subtle! There is nothing for which spies cannot be used.몯

Analysis:
몮Hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮The soldiers of the army are all to be kept close and treated as intimates, but only spies are to be kept closest to your heart, and you shall be most intimate with spies.몯
Du Mu comments: 몮They receive audiences and commands are issued to them in the inner chambers.몯
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮They enter into your chambers to receive your words; they are your closest relations.몯
Du You comments: 몮If you do not treat them with the utmost closeness and if you do not reward them handsomely, then they will become servants of the enemy and divulge information to them.몯
Any spy you send into the field has the potential to be groomed by the enemy as a 몬converted spy.몭 If you don몭t bind them to you by treating them well, giving them generous rewards and bringing them under your personal leadership, they could be used by the enemy and reveal information about your army몭s situation.
몮None should be more liberally rewarded.몯

Be willing to spend money. Spending on spy operations, no matter how expensive, comes down to pennies when you realize what you몭re buying with that money. You몭re buying the world, and you몭re buying your own life. When you choose whether or not to spend that money, you몭re choosing between gaining control of the entire world and throwing away your life. For example, during the Chu-Han Contention, when Liu Bang was surrounded by Xiang Yu몭s forces, Chen Ping said to him: 몮Are you willing to spend 40,000 gold pieces to buy spies in the chambers of the Chu council?몯 Liu Bang handed over the money immediately, without asking what the plan was, how the money would be spent, or why the price was 40,000 in gold, rather than 30,000 or 50,000.

몮In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved.몯

There몭s no other area of operations where secrecy is more important than in spying. This work belongs underground, cloaked in strict secrecy.
Du Mu comments: 몮What comes out from the mouth enters directly into the ear.몯
Du You comments: 몮If spy work is not conducted in secrecy, you will come to harm.몯
When Chen Ping was planning to pay some of Xiang Yu몭s men to spread rumors, if he hadn몭t kept tight secrecy, he definitely would have ended up dead.

몮Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮First, gauge the character of the person to be employed as a spy. They must be honest, resourceful and wise. Having assured yourself of this, only then take them into your service. They must appear innocent yet be hard to judge, and they must be willing to brave the dangers of wilderness travel. Anybody who is not a sage will fall short.몯
You can feel like you 몬know몭 someone, and yet that knowledge might only be skin-deep. With spies, you have to know their minds, their abilities and intelligence, and you have to be capable of handling them. To manage a spy, you have to be extremely wise.
Wang Xi comments: 몮Being possessed of wisdom and sagacity, you have the ability to know people.몯
Chen Ping took charge of all spy work for his lord, Liu Bang, and many people cast doubts on his character. The most famous rumor about Chen Ping was that he had an affair with his sister-in-law, even though his older brother, her husband, had always treated him well. There was no clear proof that this was true, but the rumor spread far and wide nonetheless. According to another rumor, he몭d taken bribes from his subordinates while serving as an officer in Liu Bang몭s army. He even admitted it when Liu Bang accused him, but he had an explanation  멪 he was new in the army, he had no money, and without money he couldn몭t get anything done. That몭s why he took a bribe, he said. Plenty of people spoke against him, but Liu Bang trusted him and gave him control of the most important, confidential spy work.
So, was Chen Ping a wise man? There are no historical records of his intelligence reports, of who he employed or how he did his business. However, the records do talk about something he did as a young man. In his hometown, the locals were willing to let Chen Ping be in charge of the annual offerings to the gods at the communal shrine; to act as the 몬minister of sacrifices.몭 He directed the event, and was in charge of dividing up the pork among the villagers. The reason they were happy to let Chen Ping take charge was that he always cut the meat up in exactly equal portions. As such, it was common to hear the elders and other villagers saying: 몮Bravo! Chen the scholar is our man, our minister of sacrifices!몯 Young Chen had already mastered the dividing up of the pork.
Chen Ping would get emotional and say: 몮Oh my! If I were to be made prime minister of all China, I would set about my task in the same way as cutting up this meat!몯
So, what is the main skill that people like Chen Ping have? It몭s the skill of 몬dividing up the pork.몭 What this means is having the ability to weigh the interests of everyone involved, giving full play to everyone몭s productivity, and coordinating the relationships between everyone involved. Being able to divide up the pork is something that political leaders and chief ministers must be able to do.
Chen Ping didn몭t just provide Liu Bang with a constant supply of brilliant strategy, helping him take control of all China. He also managed to protect himself after the deaths of both Liu Bang and his wife, Empress Lu, deal with the threat posed by the dead Empress몭 various relatives, keep a steady hand on the Han court and maintain the country몭s stability as prime minister of the Han Empire.

몮They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness.몯

How should we interpret the concepts of 몬benevolence and straightforwardness?몭
Chen Hao comments: 몮Benevolent men touch other people with their grace; straightforward men manage affairs in the proper way. Commanders-in-chief must be able to both bind men to them using benevolence and put them to use by using straightforwardness. Having achieved this, spies will conduct their work to the best of their abilities and serve you happily.몯
Wang Xi comments: 몮Benevolence to bind their hearts to you; straightforwardness to awaken their moral integrity.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Benevolence means being not stingy when dispensing noble rank and rewards; straightforwardness means being resolute and free of doubt. One must both entice men using generous rewards and treat them with the utmost sincerity. Thus, spies will devote all their strength to their work.몯
So, benevolence and straightforwardness are leadership qualities 멨 they enable leaders to close any emotional distance between themselves and their men, and to not hold back when giving out rewards, while also making decisions and dealing with problems decisively, without hesitating. People bend to your will because they see your character, your openness, your generosity, your sense of justice and your powers of insight. This is the way to keep your people grounded, passionately committed to serving you and blissfully unoccupied by other thoughts.

몮Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports.몯

Spy work goes so deep and takes place amid such terrible danger, and any spy can be bought over to the enemy몭s side or otherwise fall under enemy control. When you몭re in the business of handling spies, you have to give them your absolute confidence and form strong, emotional bonds with them, while at the same time remembering to trust no one. The dynamic between these two opposing needs is extremely subtle.
When a spy returns home to report, is he telling the truth? The only way to get the truth is to have spies who think and analyze at an extremely sophisticated level. It몭s possible that a spy thinks he몭s telling the truth, but actually he몭s just regurgitating false information fed to him by the enemy. Among those who fell into this trap was Liu Bang, who was otherwise such a brilliant example of using spies. For instance, he fell into a trap set for him by Modun.  As discussed earlier, he listened to the scouting parties who told him the Xiongnu were weak and vulnerable to attack, instead of listening to Lou Jing when he said the Xiongnu were only pretending to be weak as part of a strategy to draw them in. For all Liu Bang몭s wisdom, he somehow still decided to lock up Lou Jing and believe the men who told him to attack. As a result, Liu Bang almost didn몭t make it back from that war.
As is always the case with trickery, Modun몭s ruse could have come from any textbook 멪 you can find clear descriptions of what he did in any 몬Complete Guide to Trickery and Deception.몭 It couldn몭t be any simpler; it몭s even clumsy in its simplicity. Anyone could come up with something similar, and it몭s so obvious that you몭d see through it with a single glance. So, why did Liu Bang fall for it? Wasn몭t he too clever to make such a basic mistake? It was because the false information Modun fed him appealed to his desires and expectations: he was chomping at the bit to destroy the Xiongnu and win even more glory. If you have specific expectations, and if you몭re influenced by greed, you몭ll fall for people몭s tricks.
People sometimes believe things only because they want them to be true.

몮Oh, how subtle! There is nothing for which spies cannot be used.몯


Pay special attention to the low-status people who hang around major actors 멨 These are the people who can help you do big things

Extract from the original text:
몮If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told. Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and doorkeepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.몯

Analysis:
몮If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.몯
The spy is put to death as punishment for leaking information, while the person who received the leaked information is put to death to keep him quiet.
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮The spy is killed as a response to his heinous act of divulging information; the person to whom he divulged the information is killed in order to prevent him from telling the information to others.몯
In any confidential work, it몭s necessary to keep tight discipline throughout your organization. Don몭t say a word to anyone, not even your family members. The people who worked on China몭s projects to launch the country몭s first satellite and build its first atomic bomb were separated from their families for years. Their family members didn몭t even know where they몭d gone or when they몭d come back; they weren몭t even allowed to send letters to them. This is the nature of confidential work 멪 if you want people to keep a secret, the best strategy is to make sure they don몭t know the secret in the first place.
Sima Yi pretended to be sick twice in his life. The second time he did it, he tricked Cao Shuang and seized control of the state of Wei. The first time, he몭d been staying home and biding his time, hiding his strength. Cao Cao summoned him to return to work, but he didn몭t yet feel he had a clear enough understanding of the political landscape. He didn몭t want to come out of the political wilderness, so what did he do? He pretended to be sick. Specifically, he said he had rheumatism, but Cao Cao didn몭t buy it and sent a man to his house in the middle of the night to investigate. What he observed was Sima Yi lying motionless inside, his body painfully contorted. After that, Cao Cao believed him. So, whether you몭re pretending to be sick or pretending to be crazy, it몭s important to put on a consistent show, including when you몭re 몬backstage몭 and don몭t think anybody몭s watching. You can몭t afford to be careless, because an investigator could show up at any time and monitor you in secret.
One day, Sima Yi was lying on his side indoors. Meanwhile, he몭d had some of his books made of bamboo slips spread out in the courtyard, to dry in the sun. Suddenly, rain began to hammer down. Sima Yi forgot about his pretend illness the moment he realized his books were about to be ruined, and leapt up to bring them inside. After all, he was a man of learning and a lover of books. But, he몭d been spotted by one of his own serving girls. She was so shocked that her mouth hung open. Sima Yi몭s wife, Zhang Chunhua, was in the house at the time, and she made an instant decision to kill the girl on the spot. She did it with her own hands. Sima Yi wasn몭t the only wolf in his family; his wife was also quite the cold-blooded killer.

몮Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and doorkeepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.몯

There몭s a lot of information to pick through here, and it explains a lot.
The first thing mentioned in this passage is that you have to know who the enemy commander is. This is the easiest part to understand. When you fight a war, you몭re fighting against the enemy commander, and it is this man몭s competence that decides the fighting capabilities of his army. There몭s a saying that an individual soldier might fight like a lion, but when a powerful general is calling the shots, his army becomes a whole pride of lions. For example, Han Xin had the ability to gather a rag-tag band of sub-par soldiers and turn them into an elite fighting unit. Han Xin was the kind of man who could go into a market and come out again with an army at his back. In other words, he knew how to round up a mob, build it into an army and lead them into a life-and-death battle. General Zhao Kuo, on the other hand, could be given a huge army of 400,000 fighters and somehow still manage to get slaughtered on the battlefield. That몭s why, during the time leading up to the Battle of Changping, the Qin commanders focused on coming up with a way to get the leaders of Zhao to recall General Lian Po from the front lines and replace him with Zhao Kuo. Meanwhile, the Qin leaders quietly put General Bai Qi in charge of their forces, under strict secrecy. It was decreed that anyone who leaked information that Bai Qi had been made commander would be beheaded.
Just like that, the pieces on the chessboard were switched. The original matchup between Lian Po for Zhao, and Wang He for Qin, had become Zhao Kuo for Zhao and Bai Qi for Qin. This led directly to Zhao몭s defeat.
Liu Bang once sent Han Xin, Cao Can and Guan Ying to attack Wei Bao. Liu Bang asked: 몮Who is the greatest general of Wei?몯 
The answer he was given: 몮Bo Zhi.몯
Liu Bang said: 몮Bo Zhi? He몭s barely weaned from his mother몭s teat! He몭s no match for Han Xin.몯
Then Liu Bang asked another question: 몮Who is the commander of their cavalry forces?몯
The answer he was given: 몮Xiang Ta.몯 
Liu Bang said: 몮He can몭t beat Cao Can. Clearly, I have nothing to worry about!몯
So, as a commander-in-chief, you not only need to know everything about the people under your command, you must also have a thorough understanding of the personal background, military abilities, personality traits and even the hobbies and interests of each and every one of the enemy몭s generals.
We몭ve just talked about how a commander needs to understand the enemy commander, but why is it also necessary to understand his attendants, aides-de-camp, doorkeepers and sentries? Zhang Yu elaborates on this by writing about an historical example, and once again it몭s about Liu Bang. Once, Liu Bang was defeated in battle and fled, taking refuge in Han Xin몭s camp. He went straight to Han Xin몭s sleeping quarters, took possession of Han Xin몭s official seal and seized command of his forces. If he hadn몭t done meticulous groundwork beforehand, he could never have marched straight into Han Xin몭s bedchambers without startling the man, regardless of his status as commander-in-chief.
There몭s a similar historical example, except unlike Liu Bang bursting into the sleeping quarters of one of his own men, it involved someone bursting in on the enemy commander-in-chief while he was in bed. This story comes from the Spring and Autumn period, during a time when the states of Chu and Song were at war. The Chu army had been besieging the city of Handan for about a year, and the situation had deteriorated to the point that residents had begun eating one another. Despite that, the defenders of the city were hell-bent on to the death. There would be no surrender. Meanwhile, the Chu soldiers outside the city walls were exhausted. The Song forces were attempting to outlast them 멪 to wait until they몭d burned through all their resources and would be forced to leave. So, the Chu forces began to build houses, plough fields and get ready to plant crops, to show that they were prepared to settle in for the long haul. Their message was clear: they weren몭t going anywhere. Faced with this reality, the Song leader Hua Yuan snuck into the Chu camp at night, went straight to the bed of Zi Fan, the Chu commander-in-chief, and took him captive. There in Zi Fan몭s bed, the two men negotiated. The Chu forces would withdraw, and in return Hua Yuan would travel to Chu as a hostage and sign a peace treaty.
If it weren몭t for the detailed spy work he did before he made this move 멪 he몭d acquainted himself closely with Zi Fan몭s attendants, aides-de-camp, doorkeepers and sentries, and even come to a silent agreement of sorts with them 멪 how could Hua Yuan have made it to Zi Fan몭s bed?
There몭s one more example. During the Republic of China period (1912-1949 CE), there was a network of underground cells dedicated to resisting the Japanese occupation. As part of their operations, an agent named Dai Li planned to eliminate the Mayor of occupied Shanghai, Fu Xiao몭an. Who did Dai Li go through to accomplish this mission? He used a man who Fu Xiao몭an trusted completely, who몭d served him for decades and whose service spanned a regime change. He was a cook named Zhu Shengyuan. While Fu Xiao몭an was fast asleep in his official residence in Hongkou, Zhu Shengyuan cut his head off with a kitchen knife. It was true that Zhu had been a loyal servant to his master, but his loyalty to his country outweighed that.
That몭s why it몭s important to pay special attention to the low-status people who hang around major actors. These are the people who can help you accomplish big things.


There are five types of spy, but 몬Converted spies몭 are key

Extract from the original text:
몮The enemy몭s spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service. It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions. The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.몯

Analysis:
몮The enemy몭s spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.몯
This part emphasizes that, although there are five different types of spy, the most crucial of these is 몬converted spies.몭
The idea of 몬comfortably housing몭 enemy spies is actually a form of house arrest. Once they몭re safely inside a house, then you can begin to tempt them, corrupt them and bring them over to your side.
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Seek out enemy spies who have come to spy on you, and turn him into your agent by means of generous gifts, temptations and housing. In this case, the meaning of 몬housing몭 is actually detainment. The longer he is kept there, the more he will talk, and thus you will gain intelligence about the enemy.몯
The Han dynasty court and the Xiongnu often sent envoys to each other몭s seat of power, and the vast majority of these envoys also were assigned spy duties. It was common practice for both sides to detain the other몭s envoys. One of them, a man named Su Wu, was held for nineteen years and never gave in to the enemy. The story of Su Wu and how he raised sheep on the plateau later became a famous legend.

몮It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.몯

Mei Yaochen comments: 몮It becomes possible to make use of subjects and officials of the enemy state, and this is all because of knowledge acquired from converted spies.몯
Zhang Yu comments: 몮Through converted spies, you learn which of the enemy몭s people are susceptible to greedy desires, and you learn which officials of the enemy court are at odds with one another. Then, you can bring them into your service by means of enticements.몯
So, a converted spy is not necessarily someone who fully comes over to your side. It might be someone who you keep detained, who you keep wining and dining and chatting with, until eventually, inevitably, he lets something slip. As Zhang Yu writes: 몮The longer he is kept there, the more he will talk, and thus you will gain intelligence about the enemy.몯

몮It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.몯

Through the information you learn from converted spies, you can find out exactly what kind of false information can undermine the enemy with the greatest effectiveness. Then, you can dispatch 몬doomed spies몭 to deliver the message.

몮Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions.몯

From information gained from converted spies, you can find out details about the enemy몭s troop density, and use this intelligence to arrange times for 몬surviving spies몭 to return home and report on what they몭ve learned.

몮The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality.몯

In sum, converted spies are at the root of all spy work. You have to spend a lot of money on spy work, and the lion몭s share of that money needs to be spent on converted spies.

Extract from the original text:
몮Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to Yi Zhi who had served under the Xia. Likewise, the rise of the Zhou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin. Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results. Spies are a most important element in war, because on them depends an army's ability to move.몯

Analysis:
몮Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to Yi Zhi who had served under the Xia.몯
Cao Cao comments: 몮Yi Zhi is the same person as Yi Yin.몯
Yi Zhi, also known as Yi Yin, is singled out by Sun Tzu as the first Chinese historical example of a spy. The details of Yi Yin몭s background are a little complicated. It seems he was a chef, a private tutor, a royal teacher, a spy, a general, a prime minister and a sage.
Yi Zhi몭s first role was as a chef, and he몭s considered as one of the fathers of Chinese cuisine. There몭s a concept in Chinese cooking that can be translated as 몬heat control몭 (huohou). It몭s a way of talking about the strength of the cooking flame and the duration of cooking time in relation to one another. Heat control theory was Yi Zhi몭s invention, and he also came up with the idea that taste can be divided into five flavor categories. His approach to cooking had deep theoretical underpinnings.
Yi Zhi served as chef to the lord of the state of Shen, which existed during the Xia Dynasty (2070-1600 BCE), and he also served as a tutor to the children of noble families. He was devoted to the study of two fields of knowledge: crafting delicacies in the kitchen, and effective governance of large states. I have my suspicions that that a phrase coined by Lao Tzu 멪 몬Governing a large state is like cooking tiny delicacies몭 멪 might have been inspired by Yi Zhi. This seems likely to me because Lao Tzu just wrote the words, whereas Yi Zhi could in all fairness be hailed as the father of Chinese cuisine and statecraft. He has been called 몬the original sage of Shang.몭
The founder of the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BCE), Shang Tang, was so intent on bringing Yi Zhi into his service that he married a daughter of the lord of Shen. Yi Zhi was sent to Shang as part of the dowry. There몭s a passage in the ancient text, The Book of Mencius, that reads: 몮Shang Tang learned from Yi Yin and later made a minister of him. Hence, he became king easily and without toil.몯 Shang Tang honored Yi Zhi by appointing him royal teacher and taught him the ways of the legendary ancient Emperors Yao and Shun. Shang Tang also assigned Yi Zhi to five different diplomatic missions to visit the last King of Xia, Xia Jie, in the state of Jin. Yi Zhi몭s duties included befriending Xia Jie몭s favorite concubine, Mei Xi, and extracting large quantities of intelligence about the Xia dynasty. His work during these missions was pivotal to Shang Tang몭s success in finally crushing the Xia dynasty.


몮Likewise, the rise of the Zhou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin.몯

Here, Sun Tzu gives us another example of a historical spy. This time, it was Jiang Ziya, a man from Yin Shang who was pivotal to the rise of the Zhou Dynasty. Jiang Ziya once worked for King Zhou of Shang, and when he came into the service of King Wen of Zhou, he brought with him a huge amount of insider knowledge about the Shang royal court.
Over the millennia since Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War was written, many scholars have struggled to understand why he cited these two men, Yi Zhi and Jiang Ziya, as examples of spies. Some have even been downright disgruntled about it. This is because the majority of people who read, or write commentary about, The Art of War are bookish types, generally with a Confucianist bent. Within the Confucian tradition, both Yi Zhi and Jiang Ziya are venerated as sages and models of Confucian values, and the fact that Sun Tzu describes them as spies doesn몭t sit well with those values. Spies might be important, but in the framework of Confucianism, a true gentleman of noble character would never consider doing the kind of things that are routine tasks in spy work. On top of that, both Yi Zhi and Jiang Ziya played crucial roles in the founding of a new dynasty. How could their glorious contributions be chalked up as spy work?
Mei Yaochen comments: 몮Yi Yin and Lu Ya did not betray their countries. In the case of the former, the Xia dynasty was no longer fit to rule, and so the Shang dynasty rose up; in the case of the latter, the Shang dynasty was no longer fit to rule, and so the Zhou dynasty rose up. The great deeds that these men accomplished were done for the good of the people.몯 They weren몭t treacherous spies, they were moral servants of the country who chose to serve the greater good and promote the betterment of the common people몭s lives.
Zhang Yu wasn몭t happy about the choice of Zhi Yi and Jiang Ziya as examples of spies, either. He writes: 몮Yi Yin was a minister of Xia who later joined Shang; Lu Wang was a minister of Shang who later joined Zhou. Yi and Lu respectively assisted Tang and Wu to restore stability to the world through force of arms. This was in accordance with heaven and with the people of the earth. Their cases are not the same as when Bo Zhouli fled to Chu or when Miao Benhuang went over to Jin.몯
Bo Zhouli and Miao Benhuang are the two standard examples from Chinese history of men who betrayed their countries.
Bo Zhouli was a nobleman from the state of Jin whose father, Bo Zong, was persecuted by 몬the three Xis.몭 He fled his home and went to Chu, where he was appointed prime minister.
Miao Benhuang was a nobleman from the state of Chu. He had the surname Mi, and the clan name Dou. He was in the same clan as Ruo Aoshi, and was the son of Yin Doujiao, who held the official rank of guoling. During the ninth year of the reign of King Zhuang of Chu, Yin Doujia launched a rebellion that soon failed, after which King Zhuang set about exterminating all members of his clan. That was when Miao Benhuang fled to Jin, where the rulers appointed him Chief Strategist and he became one of the venerated 몬eight good ministers of Jin.몭
During the Battle of Yanling, between Jin and Chu, the two men were standing by their respective lords몭 sides, feeding them insider intelligence about the opposing army and making suggestions. Miao Benhaung was the most talented, and the Jin army prevailed.
The Battle of Yanling is a classic example of a major Spring and Autumn period military campaign, and the history books contain vivid records about both of these treacherous officials:
In one such account, Bo Zhouli accompanied King Gong of Chu on an excursion to observe the Jin army camp.
The King of Chu asked: 몮The Jin soldiers are driving their chariots and moving all around at high speed. What are they doing?몯
Bo Zhouli said: 몮They are assembling their officers.몯
The King of Chu said: 몮Those people have gathered in the middle of the camp.몯
Bo Zhouli said: 몮They are holding a meeting. They are discussing among themselves.몯
The King of Chu said: 몮They have erected tents.몯
Bo Zhouli said: 몮They are communing with the late king to divine whether the omens are good or bad.몯
The King of Chu said: 몮Now they have taken down the tents.몯
Bo Zhouli said: 몮They will soon issue commands.몯
The King of Chu said: 몮How noisy it is, and there is dust flying around.몯
Bo Zhouli said: 몮That is because they are preparing to fill in their wells and smash their cooking ranges. They will soon form battle lines.몯
The King of Chu said: 몮They have mounted their war chariots and the men to left and right have taken up weapons and lined up in formation.몯
Bo Zhouli said: 몮They are listening to their commander몭s instructions and commands.몯
The King of Chu asked: 몮Do they mean to start the battle?몯
Bo Zhouli said: 몮I do not know yet.몯
The King of Chu said: 몮Now they have once more mounted their war chariots, and the people to left and right have come down.몯
Bo Zhouli said: 몮They are now making their pre-battle prayers to the gods.몯
Reading this dialogue, we can see why spies are to be feared! Because of them, your enemy can see straight through every little move you make.
Bo Zhouli also told King Gong of Chu where Duke Li of Jin몭s personal unit was located. With this information, the Chu forces knew exactly where they could find the enemy leader.
Of course, Miao Benhuang was providing the same services to the other side, so Chu and Jin were in much the same situation 멪 the Jin forces also knew where the personal forces of King Gong of Chu were located. However, the information Miao Benhuang provided to his side wasn몭t as detailed or vividly expressed, or even as gossipy as Bo Zhouli몭s. But gossipy tidbits don몭t serve much practical use; unlike Bo Zhouli, Miao Benhuang몭s information cut straight to the most crucial details. One of his suggestions for Duke Li of Jin went like this: 몮The Chu forces몭 elite unit is located in the middle of their army, and for the most part they consist of the Chu king몭s personal soldiers. If you allocate some of our elite soldiers to attack and pin down the Chu forces on both flanks of their army, and then focus our entire attacking power on an assault against the personal unit of the Chu king, then we will surely be able to inflict a heavy defeat upon them.몯
Duke Li of Jin did as Miao advised. The Chu army was defeated and withdrew.
King Gong of Chu decided to fight again the next day. On the Jin side, Miao Benhuang informed the entire army that they must prepare to fight again the following day, and then he deliberately let the Chu prisoners of war get away so that they would rejoin their armies and report to their leaders that the Jin forces were preparing to fight. When King Gong found out that the Jin forces were already prepared, he immediately summoned Zi Fan for a consultation about how to respond. But it was nighttime, and Zi Fan was drunk. He couldn몭t answer his lord몭s summons. With no other options, King Gong withdrew his army under the cover of darkness. And that몭s how the Battle of Yanling ended in victory for the Jin forces.
This is why Sun Tzu emphasizes the importance of spies. If you talk about the most valuable personnel you could acquire, nobody몭s more valuable than people from within the enemy몭s organization. But, when you recruit enemy personnel, you have to make sure you get the right people. If you don몭t, you still won몭t be able to defeat your enemies.

몮Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results. Spies are a most important element in war, because on them depends an army's ability to move.몯

Du Mu comments: 몮Without information about the actual situation of the enemy, your army cannot move. There is no way to gain information about the enemy that does not require the use of spies. Hence it is said: 몬On them depends an army's ability to move.몭몯
Li Quan comments: 몮Sun Tzu몭s treatise about war begins with calculations and ends with spies, for attacking is not the most important thing. How could those who would be generals not reflect upon this with the utmost care?몯
This comment from Li Quan serves well as a conclusion for this book. The essential core of Sun Tzu몭s way of thinking is expressed in just four words:
몮Win first, fight later.몯
The purpose of making calculations is to win before fighting, and to only raise an army once you몭re sure of victory. Likewise, the purpose of spies is also to win before fighting. Once you have information about the enemy몭s situation, and if you know both yourself and your enemy, it몭s time to go out and fight.
And what is the key to winning first and fighting later? Don몭t fight if you can몭t win.
If you can몭t see a clear path to victory, don몭t move. The art of war is mainly about learning how not to fight, not how to fight. You need to be able to stay out of fights and protect yourself, and you also need to be able to settle a conflict in a single engagement. If you can do that, you몭ve fully understood the opening words from the first chapter of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War: 몮The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.몯
Regardless of what we몭re trying to achieve, we need to adopt 몬win first, fight later몭 as our way of thinking. Work everything out at the planning stage, and only then take action. If you don몭t do anything, that doesn몭t matter. In many situations, waiting is the best strategy. Among all the factors that effect developing events, there몭s one that plays the ultimate role in deciding outcomes. That factor is time. You need to understand how to wait; you need patience. You need the ability to observe and exploit the changes that time brings. You also need to exploit time itself, in order to manufacture changes.
It was time that took Chairman Mao away and gave us Deng Xiaoping, the man who brought reform to China. If you try to resist the effects of time and impose yourself, you몭ll end up with nothing.
Don몭t always be itching to do something. Many so-called 몬strategic measures몭 are just reflections of strategists몭 anxieties and nerves. You might feel that, unless you do something, you몭re being 몬passive.몭 Or, you might worry that your commander will think you몭re useless, and your king might think you몭re negligent, so you end up beside yourself with anxiety. In that worried state, you may conclude that the only way you can get some relief from these intense emotions is to do something, anything! But, as soon as you move, you become another example of the saying: 몬If you don몭t put yourself in death몭s way, you won몭t die.몭


Appendix: Complete text of The Use of Spies

Sun Tzu said: 몮Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor. Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy몭s condition, simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation. Knowledge of the enemy몭s dispositions can only be obtained from other men.
몮Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local spies; (2) Inward spies; (3) Converted spies; (4) Doomed spies; (5) Surviving spies. When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called 몬divine manipulation of the threads.몭 It is the sovereign몭s most precious faculty. Having local spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district. Having inward spies means making use of officials of the enemy. Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy몭s spies and using them for our own purposes. Having doomed spies, doing certain things openly for purposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy. Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy몭s camp.
몮Hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightforwardness. Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports. Oh, how subtle! There is nothing for which spies cannot be used.
몮If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told. Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and doorkeepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these.
몮The enemy몭s spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service. It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on appointed occasions. The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost liberality. Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty was due to Yi Zhi who had served under the Xia. Likewise, the rise of the Zhou dynasty was due to Lu Ya who had served under the Yin. Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results. Spies are a most important element in war, because on them depends an army's ability to move.몯


Epilogue: The final conclusion 멨 The nine essential threads of the thinking behind Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War

By the time you finish reading through The Art of War, you will have realized that it몭s not as mysterious as it몭s made out to be. It몭s not some kind of secret scroll; it몭s a vessel for simple, ordinary principles, expressed in clear, sensible terms. As it turns out, simplicity has always been 몬The Way of Sages.몭 The reason we can몭t become powerful, mighty beings is that we don몭t like the idea of ordinariness. We always make things so complicated, because we don몭t believe in simplicity.
As my final summary of Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, I have organized the core threads of his way of thinking into nine points:

1) The art of war is about strength trumping weakness, not weakness trumping strength.
The first chapter is about 몬calculations,몭 not to be confused with 몬ingenious strategems,몭 which is another possible translation of the root Chinese character ji (?[bd49]). It corresponds to the modern-day SWOT analytical framework: Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat. The idea of 몬carrying out calculations in the temple몭 is about weighing and comparing both sides몭 political, economic and military strengths, while you몭re still safely at home, before you decide to go to war. There몭s also the framework of 몬The five factors and the seven considerations,몭 which is a system for assigning scores to the various items up for comparison. Whichever side scores more points will win; whichever side scores fewer points will lose. Once you finish these evaluations, you몭ll know who몭s going to win. 

And then, once you know you can win, you can summon your officers, mobilize your army and go to war.

If your calculations give you a score lower than your enemy몭s, don몭t fight. This is why Sun Tzu didn몭t believe in trying to beat strength with weakness 멪there몭s a low probability of a successful outcome. 몮The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.몯 Sun Tzu would never have bet the fate of his country몭s people on a low probability outcome.


2) Even if you can win a war, you still need to calculate the cost of victory.

Every action comes with a price, and the price of war is enormous. Don몭t think only about winning; you need to keep count of the costs you몭ll rack up along the way and decide whether it몭s worth it. Li Ke said; 몮For Marquis Wen of Wei, many victories will lead to his certain ruin.몯 You can win a lot of battles, and yet all those victories can lead to your country몭s destruction. This is because constant fighting leaves the people exhausted, while frequent victories tend to make lords arrogant. An arrogant lord leading an exhausted populace is a recipe for a failed state.

The great Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty was a true example of this, as represented by his immortal words: 몮Any who dare use force against Han will surely be brought to the executioner, no matter how far away they may be.몯 The arrogance is breathtaking! Emperor Wu spent his life hacking away at the borders of his empire and expanding his territory, and for his efforts he won himself a glittering military record. But, what was the end result? Both the government and the people of China were bankrupt, he drove the country to the brink of destruction, and in his later years he was forced under heavy political pressure from his government, and made to kneel and confess his guilt. This is what he said during his self-criticism: 몮Since the time when I ascended the throne, I have engaged in many wanton acts, and have caused distress to all under heaven. It is now too late for regret. Starting from today, there will be a halt to all activities being detrimental to the common folk and squandering the resources of all under heaven.몯

3) Win first, fight later.

Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War is primarily about ways to strengthen yourself. First and foremost, you have to train and improve yourself instead of always thinking about other people and how to defeat them.

Sun Tzu wrote: 몮The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.몯 He also wrote: 몮One may know how to obtain victory without being able to achieve it,몯 and 몮Those who are skilled in war obtain victory first, and then fight.몯 Don몭t look for victory on the battlefield; look for a battle after you몭ve already won.

Train and practice until you몭re strong. Make yourself undefeatable, leave no chinks in your armor, and then wait until a chink appears in your enemy몭s armor. If the enemy isn몭t weaker than you, or if you몭re evenly matched 멪 and if they don몭t make any mistakes, or leave any gaps in their defenses 멪 you can몭t attack. 몮The opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.몯 In other words, victory comes the moment the enemy makes a mistake.

If the enemy doesn몭t make a mistake, there몭s no way you can win.

So, it몭s possible to judge and know ahead of time whether the outcome will be victory or defeat, but you can몭t make victory happen. As soon as the opportunity for victory appears, grab it and fight. You can몭t turn this formula around 멪 if you charge into a fight casually, and look for a path to victory once the battle has already started, you몭re putting yourself in danger.


4) You have to be able to wait; patience is a necessity.

These days, people often repeat the saying, 몬If you don몭t go looking for death, you won몭t die.몭 The Art of War talks about this more than anything else. In war, the profits and the costs are totally disproportionate to each other. If you kill 1,000 enemy soldiers, but lose 800 of your own, there isn몭t necessarily any significant benefit in it for you. But if you lose, you face the prospect of your country몭s destruction, the death of your entire family and the loss of your own life. That몭s why it몭s crucial to be able to wait. You mustn몭t get twitchy and move around a lot just because you feel anxious. When Shuge Han was holding Tongguan Pass, he knew he was in no position to fight. But although he had the ability to wait, Emperor Xuanzong didn몭t 멪 the anxious Emperor forced Shuge Han to leave the safety of the pass and start a fight, which led to the total destruction of his army. When Wang Jian of Qin invaded Chu, he had the ability wait, and he also had the ability to sooth the nerves of the first Emperor of Qin and prevent him from becoming anxious. This enabled Wang Jian to lead a massive army of 600,000 soldiers into Chu territory, set up camp, and while away the days holding contests for his soldiers until finally the people of Chu grew anxious and began to move about, which opened up gaps in their defenses. Then, Wang Jian pounced and destroyed the state of Chu in a single move.

Waiting is the best strategy in many different situations. And yet, people often believe that if you wait, you몭re being passive. They think waiting is unacceptable.

This is what people need to understand: it몭s perfectly acceptable to be 몬passive,몭 even for your entire lifetime, because the consequences of taking action might include your own death.

Look at Japan몭s Tokugawa Ieyasu[bd51], for example. He perfected the waiting game. Nobody had greater patience than him, and nobody was better at compromising. When Oda Nobunaga was in power, Tokugawa was a young boy; when Toyotomi Hideyoshi came to power, Tokugawa had become a powerful regional lord. Did Tokugawa at any point try to force his ambitions, to make them a reality? No, he didn몭t. He could wait and he could compromise. While Toyotomi Hideyoshi was strong, Tokugawa was content to maintain his status as just another regional lord, for as long as it took. In the end, he outlived his rivals and his road to total power came unblocked. Even so, he bided his time for another 17 years after Toyotomi Hideyoshi몭s death before steadily taking control of all Japan. After him, his descendants ruled over Japan for more than 200 years.

5) Settle the score in a single move. If you win a battle without ending the war, your victory is meaningless.

Victory is a tool, not an objective. The objective is stability. It몭s possible to win a war and yet not secure a stable outcome. If you win 100 battles, and yet still have to keep fighting, what몭s the point in the hundred victories? Even when you win, people still die. And even if it몭s only the enemy몭s men who die, it would still be better for them to have lived and come over to your side. That몭s how you defeat your enemy and make yourself stronger at the same time. Sun Tzu몭s way of thinking has a strong emphasis on preservation 멪 self-preservation, preservation of the people, preservation of cities, preservation of wealth and, ideally, preservation of enemy subjects so that you can bring them over to work for you. Only by doing all these things can you create universal stability.

During the Warring States period, the Zhao general Li Mu was assigned to command a border garrison, to defend against Xiongnu raids. His strategy was to close the gates and focus entirely on training his troops. For years he didn몭t venture out to fight the enemy, which didn몭t please the King of Zhao. And so, the king decided to replace Li Mu with a different general. Just over a year after the new general took up his post, there was 몬a new normal.몭 The signal fires were constantly lit, there was fighting each and every day. The lives of the Chinese people living in the borderlands was so disrupted that they couldn몭t take proper care of their farms, the Xiongnu people couldn몭t take proper care of their herds, and both sides suffered terrible loss of life. Resentment between the two sides spiraled, and soon there was no peace to be had.

The King of Zhao ultimately reinstated Li Mu. Frankly, he had no other options. Back in his post, Li Mu went on with his old strategy of avoiding battle and cutting off all contact with the Xiongnu. Several uneventful years went by at the border. The Xiongnu, without anything to steal, gradually let down their guard. Suddenly, Li Mu launched a major attack and wiped out over 100,000 Xiongnu fighters in one fell swoop, stabilizing the frontier and securing peace for the next dozen or more years.

6) 몮Use the regular to engage the enemy, and the irregular to defeat him.몯
	
This is one of the best-known lines in Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War. Earlier in this book, we looked in detail at many examples of these words from Chinese military history. We talked about how the word 몬irregular몭 is the correct translation of the root Chinese character, although it is often mistakenly interpreted to mean 몬extraordinary.몭 It means 몬irregular몭 in the mathematical sense of 몬odd,몭 as in 몬even numbers and odd numbers.몭 It몭s the part of the army that몭s left over or kept in reserve 멪 the card you keep up your sleeve until the crucial moment, before finally pulling it out and securing victory.

This is known as 몬The art of dividing forces,몭 and it몭s one of the most fundamental principles of battle tactics. It몭s indispensable in any armed conflict, whether you have an army of a million troops or, like Xiang Yu during his last stand by the River Wu, you몭re down to your last 28 cavalry soldiers. In both scenarios, you have to divide up your army into two forces that can cover each other. Don몭t mass all your men together in a single unit. When Han Xin fought that famous battle with his back to a deep river, he didn몭t put his entire army up against the river. If he had, he really would have ended up as fish food that day. Before the action started, he split off an auxiliary force and used it to set up an ambush. Then, at the crucial moment 멪 when the battle hung in the balance 멪 he suddenly sprang them into action. That was how he secured his victory.

People tend to believe that by using surprise attacks you can defeat a much larger force, but this is the mentality of people who trust in their own luck. They몭re always thinking about what kind of fancy maneuver they can pull out of the bag, but Sun Tzu is here to tell them that there is no luck in the art of war. Fancy maneuvers go wrong, and the only way to do things is by following the rules of combat and the lessons from the art of war.

7) The Way of Deception just isn몭t important.

몮The art of war is the way of deception.몯 These words are from Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, and that misleads a lot of people. They might think that the art of war is about the same kind of thing as The Thirty-Six Stratagems 멪 namely, the use of deception to win wars. But, if your opponent doesn몭t bite, you can use deception until you몭re blue in the face and it won몭t do you any good. The art of deception is not a major part of the. These days, lots of publishing houses combine Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War and The Thirty-Six Stratagems into a single book, which makes it seem like the art of war is all about clever stratagems and tricks. This is a mistake.

8) Know yourself and know your enemy, but remember that the key is to know yourself.

몮If you know the enemy and you know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.몯 When people repeat these words, they tend to think more about knowing their enemy, and that it goes without saying that they know themselves. 몬How could I not know myself,몭 they think. But in reality, the crucial part of this formula is knowing yourself. This is because being undefeatable is entirely up to you. If you몭re strong and don몭t make mistakes, nobody else can do anything to get to you. Yet, even if you do everything you can to know your enemy, you still might fall prey to their tricks.

Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War covers a lot of ground, but it all comes back to getting your fundamentals right. Manage your own affairs properly, make yourself strong and wait until an opportunity presents itself. Wait until you have the strongest possible grasp of the situation, and then make your move. Win first, fight later. Settle the score in a single move.

If you몭re not strong, don몭t pretend to be.

9) The art of war doesn몭t teach you how to win. More than anything, it teaches you how to admit defeat.

Why do people thrill to the words, 몬I몭ll never surrender!몭 It몭s because they don몭t like to hear bad news; they몭re not willing to hear the truth when it doesn몭t fit their interests. Then there몭s the phrase, 몬Admitting defeat is the only way to win!몭 People can, at a stretch, just about accept this concept, because the end result is still a win.

But, what if the end result wasn몭t a win? What if it was still a loss?

Can you accept losing?

Before you began to seriously study Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War, you might have thought of it as a profound book about how to win in war. This is true, of course. Information about how to win wars and deep profundity 멪 it몭s all here in this book.

However, if by studying the art of war you can learn how to accept failure, then and only then have you truly stepped through the gates of wisdom.

UPDATE : As I got further down I saw that on Page 10 this #2 footer citation appears again, and it is in fact following a #2 in the text, ad it is complete (continues on following the word 몬context.몭  So멞 I removed the entire #2 citation here, at the bottom of page 2. 
[bd2]NOTE:  As you will see throughout the manuscript 멨 beginning here, in the first such reference 멨 the original text in all instances had the author몭s name (Sun Tzu) in italic, as part of the title of the book멞 and, the word 몬The몭 was missing from the title of the book.  Per conventional style, the book title should appear in italic, but not the author몭s name. The author몭s name is not part of the book title.  It is 몬The Art of War몭멞 and it was written by Sun Tzu.  The title of the book is not  just 몬Art of War,몭 and not 몬Sun Tzu몭s Art of War몭 or 몬Sun Tzu몭s The Art of War.몭.  If you wish to mention the author몭s name along with the title of the book, as is done repeated in these pages, it must be --> Su Tzu몭s The Art of War.  Accordingly, I am correcting all such references throughout the manuscript.  
[bd3]NOTE: This lower-case spelling of 몬the art of war몭 IS NOT A TYPO!  Throughout the book, that term appears in two ways.  (1.) when Sun Tzu몭s book is referenced, it appears as initial-caps and in italic (The Art of War).  (2.) Additionally, here are many generic references to the overall approach to planning & managing warfare, and in those instances it appears as lower-case and not in italic (the art of war). 
[bd4]NOTE:  In the references at the bottom of this page, #5 (몬Four-character idioms멞몭) is incomplete.  The end of the first line has the word 몮and,몭 but then stops right there, with the sentence(s) remaining incomplete.  Needs to be fixed.  
[bd5]NOTE:  The footnote below -- #4 멨 also appeared at the bottom of the preceding page.  I did not remove it here or there, because I몭m not sure what몭s up with that.  Needs to be looked at and fixed as appropriate.
[bd6]NOTE:  Yes, this book was originally published in Chinese, years ago, and this is a new English-language translation멞 but do you want a six-year-old time-stamp on the author몭s introduction?  Makes it seem like something quite old and dated, right up front, as opposed to being something new and current that a reader should be interested in.  Because this is a newly translated edition, being published now, for the first time, how about changing the date to 28 December 2019멞 or something?
[bd7]NOTE:  This is the first of just five or six instances in the entire manuscript where a Chinese character is shown 멨 in parentheses 멨 along with an explanation of what a word means.  As per my four other notations that follow through the hundreds of pages ahead, this Chinese character is is out of place and should be deleted, as it is inconsistent with the hundreds and hundreds of other words that are explained, but with no Chinese character inserted.  Needs to be fixed. 
[TT8R7]I disagree. I understand the editor몭s point, but on balance, I think including the Chinese character in these cases adds value to the text. In each case, I included the Chinese character because it would be impossible to clearly and fully convey the meaning of the ST without including them. It also has value as a reference point for readers who are especially interested in Chinese language and culture and who would enjoy researching some of the book몭s themes in more detail.
[bd9]NOTE:  I have made the beginning of each paragraph over the next several pages < not > indented, because for the many hundreds of pages that then follow, the beginning of each and every paragraph is not indented.  Other than slipping into 몬indented몭 here for a couple pages, the rest of the manuscript has all paragraphs beginning flush-left.  
[bd10]NOTE:  Per a handful of other notations throughout the manuscript, this is another of the just 5 or 6 instances where a Chinese character is dropped in, along with the explanation of a word.  Of the many hundreds of words that are defined, there are only a half-dozen places where a Chinese character then also appears in parentheses.  This is quite inconsistent, and really sticks out as being out of synch with the style throughout.  Needs to be fixed.
[bd11]NOTE:  The footnote below -- 몬The Daily Necessities멞몭 appeared at the bottom of page 2 as well.  I did not delete it here, but it is redundant and should preferably be deleted here.
[bd12]NOTE:  This is now the third time that this exact, identically-worded footote has appeared ( #12, below)멞 following the third time that this excerpt from The Art of War has been spotlighted.  I pointed this out previously, when it appeared the second time, but I have not deleted any of them.  Needs to be looked at and fixed as necessary.  Really jumps out at this point, as redundant and unnecessary.  
[bd13]NOTE:  This spelling is correct: his last name begins with a lower-case letter 몬l.몭 
[bd14]NOTE:  The deleted material below was repeated, word for word, immediately after having just appeared here.  It was a duplicated block of copy.
[bd15]NOTE:  See my notation on the following page regarding this Chinese character appearing here in parentheses.  The few instances of this through this very long manuscript stick out as inconsistent, because countless Chinese words and idioms are described, defined ad explained, yet there are only six or seven places in more than 600 pages where a Chinece character appears in parentheses.  I몭m suggesting 멨 here and in the other six instnces that follow 멨 that these be deleted.  
[bd16]NOTE:  I몭m curious why Chinese characters in parentheses are just appearing for just the second time in 174 pages -- on the preceding page and here on this page.  The manuscript up to this point has been absolutely full of references to what old Chinese characters and sayings and idioms meant멞 but these are the first places (perhaps there were a rare one or two earlier that I몭m losing sight of) that have Chinese characters in parentheses to illustrate what a term looked like in the original Chinese.   I would suggest that similar illustrations of the original Chinese characters be included in all earlier references 멨 and there are probably hundreds and hundreds of them in in the preceding 174 pages 멨 or delete them here, as they몭re inconsistent and really stick out as something we have not seeing in the narrative all along.
     
[bd17]NOTE:  I changed causal to adaptive here so that it watched the wording in this chapter몭s header, above.  The word causal appeared nowhere else 멨 it몭s referred to as adaptive energy in all references except here.  
[bd18]NOTE:  I deleted the paragraph that was here because it was an identical, word-for-word cut & paste of a paragraph that appeared just a page or two above. 
[bd19]NOTE:  This same passage 멨 the preceding four sentences 멨 appeared word-for-word just three pages earlier (page 245).  As with a similar redundancy I highlighted, I did not delete it, because the manuscript has countless verbatim passages repeated again & again, in a way that is clearly the author몭s intended style.  In this case, though, the identically-worded passages appear so close together that the reader will be thinking, 몬Hey, I just read that.몭  Should be looked at here, and on page 145, and deleted in one of these two duplications.  
[bd20]NOTE:  We몭ve already stated twice previously that this was an ancient military text.
[bd21]NOTE:  You can몭t use the word itself as its definition 멨 you couldn몭t very well say that a policy is the policy you use.  Hence, changed policy to practices here.
[bd22]NOTE:  Once again 멨 per earlier notations 멨 this is the footnote that appears again and again, identically worded, in the manuscript.
[bd23]NOTE:  It몭s strange that this 몬prominent Chinese expert몭 is not named here.  All other commentators on The Art of War are certainly identified in these pages  멨 their scholarship and various, often-conflicting, interpretations of the ancient text are what this book is all about. Yet, this particularly 몬prominent몭 one 멨 with whom the author takes issue 멨 remains unnamed.  He's the only one whose scholarship is cited, but he is simply referred to as an anonymous  'expert' on the matter being discussed.  This person obviously needs to be identified here.  Needs to be fixed.
[TT24R23]I agree 멨 Perhaps the publishing house could look into this.
[bd25]NOTE:  Same as the previous notation -- this second 'highly regarded expert' needs to be identified by name.  Why is there a long paragraph on his assertions, which the author happens to take issue with, that does not name him? In this case, he몭s even described as a 몬distinguished professor,몭 yet his identity is kept from us.  Identifying those who he agrees with, but anonymously referencing 멨 and directly quoting 멨 two individuals whose conclusions he disagrees with, does not pass 몬the sniff test.몭 This is a glaring hole that needs to be fixed.  
[bd26]NOTE:  We had sentence after sentence here that were a complete, word-for-word cut & paste of a paragraph that had  appeared just a few lies earlier. That몭s why I condensed/changed it as I did here.  It really stuck out as redundant, with the reader just having read the entirely repeated paragraph.
[bd27]NOTE:  This entire paragraph appears, word-for-word, just three pages above this, at the top of page 307.  I did not delete it in either place, but it is strikingly redundant 멨 the reader will be struck that he or she just read these six complete lines of text, verbatim, just pages ago.  Needs to be looked at and fixed as appropriate.   
[bd28]NOTE:  As noted earlier, this is the correct speling of his last name: lower-case 몬l.몭
[bd29]NOTE:  I do not know why these four words are highlighted in dark red like this.  I have tried to de-highlight them, but cannot seem to be able to do so.  < ?!?! >
[TT30R29]Fixed.
[bd31]NOTE:  These following lines are a direct cut & paste of a paragraph that appeared two pages earlier, on Pg. 377.  I ddeleted it here. The word-for-word duplication should be deleted either here or there.
[bd32]NOTE:  In trying to make these paragraphs uniformly formatted from page to page, I somehow messed up the numbering --> 3), 4), etc. This bullet is supposed to be #3멞 the next one, on page 399, is supposed to be #4멞 etc.  I tried to work with it because this section -- #3, Temporizing the ground 멨 was not indented as it should have been.  The entire piece was flush-left.  The numbering from here on down needs to be fixed멞 and the indentation of the entire bit needs to be fixed. 
[bd33]NOTE:  There is an inconsistency here.  In originally laying out these six points, on the previous page, #2 is 몬Looseness.몭  And here, on the next page, #2 it said 몬Insubordination.몭  I changedInsubordination to Looseness because, in all subsequent references going forward, we have 몬Looseness.몭 
[bd34]NOTE:  Following on from the notation above, should this be 몬looseness몭 or 몬insubordination?몭  The author will need to decide.  The word 몬looseness몭 is used onward through the text here, so if he wants it changed to 몬insubordination,몭 that change will need to be made down through the text.
[TT35R34]Fixed. Looseness is the correct choice.
[bd36]NOTE:  This has been widely reported on by the global news media for decades, and is universally known.  It몭s certainly not just Chinese readers who are familiar with it. 
[TT37R36]I wouldn몭t say it몭s universally known in the west. But perhaps the average reader of this book is more likely to know about this. The editor몭s correction can stand.
[bd38]NOTE:  This is only the second time in 437 pages that a Chinese character has appeared in the manuscript.  I noted early-on, where the first and only other instance of this occurred, that it looked out of place.  Now, after hundreds of pages, and countless hundreds of references to Chinese terms and their meaning, we have a single, stand-alone instance of this again here.  I would suggest removing the Chinese character in parentheses, as it is not consistent with the rest of the book, and really sticks out as something we haven몭t been seeing all along. 
[bd39]NOTE:  Formatting situation 멨 I cannot get this paragraph (몬In reality, it몭s not guaranteed멞몭) to indent properly, as the paragraphs above and below it are indented.  Needs to be fixed.
[TT40R39]Fixed.
[bd41]NOTE:  I deleted the paragraph below because it was an identical, word-for-word cut & paste of an earlier paragraph on this same page.  It has already literally appeared at the top of this page. 
[bd42]NOTE:  This does not make sense.  Get behind enemy lines before the enemy does?  By definition, 몬behind enemy lines몭 means inside enemy territory. It is where the enemy resides.  It would be metaphysically impossible for one to get behind the enemy몭s lines before the enemy does, because enemy lines quite literally means that 몬behind those lines is where the enemy is.몭  I did not delete this, or try to change it, because I can't guess at what the author could be trying to convey there멞 but the author needs to look at this and clarify/change it, as appropriate.  Needs to be fixed.  
[bd43]NOTE:  Bush invaded Iraq, not Obama.  Bush was president when he did so, in 2003.  Obama was not elected president until six years later, in 2008.
[bd44]NOTE:  Similar to two other notations, this is only the third time in 491 pages 멨 despite hundreds of references to the meanings of Chinese terms 멨 that we see a Chinese character in parentheses.  I would suggest deleting the Chinese character, as it is completely out of place in a lengthy manuscript where such parenthetical citations do not otherwise occur.  And even in the same paragraph, the character is provide for that one word (wei) but in the very next sentence, the term 몬qi몭 does not have an accompanying Chinese character.  Inconsistent and really sticks out as such.  Needs to be fixed.
[bd45]NOTE:  This is inaccurate / doesn몭t make sense.  As noted earlier (on page 485), George W. Bush was president when the US invaded Iraq, not Barack Obama.  And here, 30 pages later, it says that Obama pulled the US out of Iraq because he was unwilling to stay mired in the conflict... but that몭s also incorrect.  Obama left office in 2016, when Trump was elected. And now, four years later, during the Trump administration, thousands of US troops are still engaged in military operations in Iraq. A simple search online will reveal that as of August 2020, the US troop count on active duty in Iraq is pegged at around 5,200... and there are also sizeable contingents of US military contractors and subcontractors on the ground there.   And so, besides the incorrect Obama reference on page 485, and the erroneous Obama statement in this paragraph, the final sentence in this paragph is also inaccurate. That is, the US didn't run away from the conflict in Iraq, because it is still very much mired in ongoing warfare there, with US troop combat deaths reported in the news.   The aforementioned passage on page 485 needs to be corrected, and the two inaccurate pieces of this paragraph need to be corrected.          
[TT46R45]No need for further edits. I understand the editor몭s point, but I think he is misguided here.. This paragraph does not address the initial 2003 invasion of Iraq, but rather the American involvement in Iraq as a whole, which includes the time period of Obama몭s presidency. Also, Obama did stage a major (but not complete) withdrawal from Iraq.
[bd47]NOTE:  Same notation as in three previous instances 멨 in 515 pages, this is just the fourth place where a Chinese character appears in parentheses to explain a word.  There are many hundreds of such words explained throughout the manuscript, but only three other places 멨 this being the fourth 멨 where a Chinese character is dropped in there in parentheses.  It is inconsistent, and really sticks out as being so.  Needs to be fixed (몬deleted몭).
[bd48]NOTE:  Is this meant to say that 몬the start-up몭 is simply too much money, instead of as it몭s currently written (that 몬the corporation몭 is worth too much)?  I did not change it, because it몭s not clear멞 but in context, it would seem that it should say that the billion-dollar start-up is simply worth too much멞. not that the big company that몭s considering buying it is worth too much.  Needs to be looked at and fixed as appropriate. 
[bd49]NOTE:  Same as four other notations through the manuscript: this is only the fifth time in 547 pages -- which are absolutely packed with hundreds of references to Chinese words and their meaning -- that a Chinese character appears.  As in the earlier four other instances, this is inconsistent and looks really out of place.   Would suggest deleting the Chinese character here, as in the other four instances.  It will in no way detract from the author defining the term, which he otherwise does quite clearly. 
[bd50]NOTE:  Same as four other notations through the manuscript: this is only the fifth time in 547 pages -- which are absolutely packed with hundreds of references to Chinese words and their meaning -- that a Chinese character appears.  As in the earlier four other instances, this is inconsistent and looks really out of place.   Would suggest deleting the Chinese character here, as in the other four instances.  It will in no way detract from the author defining the term, which he otherwise does quite clearly. 
[bd51]NOTE:  As noted in previousl reference to this individual, this is the correct speling of his last name: lower-case 몬l.몭
