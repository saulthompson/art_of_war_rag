My personal background is in entrepreneurship, so some chapters contain brief discussions of lessons for corporate management and entrepreneurial competitiveness mixed in with the primary content."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "But, these are side-notes to the main historical narrative, and a part of my writing process of following where my thoughts take me. This book is not about looking at 'corporate warfare' through the lens of The Art of War. Rather, it is about really getting to the heart of Sun Tzu's masterwork as an ancient text, and understanding what it means in its original context. This book has been built on the shoulders of generations of Chinese scholars who have continued Sun Tzu's life's work by writing their own commentaries about The Art of War. Specifically, this book is based on the writings of 11 commentators who have forged a place in history, and whose work was first compiled in a Song dynasty (960-1279 CE) book, Eleven Commentaries on Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Each chapter in my book begins with a brief review of their work, before swiftly delving into a deeper analysis and discussion2."

    "content": "So, who are 'The Eleven Commentators?' If you want their names, they are Cao Cao, Meng Shi, Li Quan, Gu Lin, Du You, Du Mu, Chen Hao, Wang Xi, Mei Yaochen, He Shi and Zhang Yu. But who were they, really?"
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "The first to write a commentary on Sun Tzu's work was Cao Cao, who jotted the following musings about his contribution: ¡§I have read many books about war and heard of many military strategies, and of all of these Sun Tzu's writings are the most profound. But it would be impossible for ordinary people to grasp the lessons within, and there is much that is superfluous, and so this text is unable to fulfill its purpose in the world."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "For this reason, I have written a commentary to elucidate its meaning.\"\nCao Cao spent a lifetime on the campaign trail during the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 CE). He is a giant figure in the annals of Chinese history, not only for his peerless military mind but also as a rare talent in the art of governance."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Because of his towering historical stature, his commentary has received the most serious attention, and I would assert that his is also the most accurate of all the commentaries. Large parts of this book follow Cao Cao's lead."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Sadly, Cao Cao was very sparing with his words, and what he did write is succinct to a fault. He even said that Sun Tzu was too wordy! After all, Cao Cao was a professional ¡V a powerful warlord and a poet ¡V and he was not writing for the benefit of ordinary people."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "As much as we might wish otherwise, he has left us even fewer words than Sun Tzu himself. About our second commentator, Meng Shi, not much is known regarding his real name, his place of birth, and most other details about his life. We don't even know for sure during which dynasty he lived, although it's possible he lived during the Liang dynasty of the Southern dynasties (420-589 CE) period."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Not much of his commentary is still with us today, but he did leave us some useful material to work with. Next up, Li Quan lived during the Tang dynasty, probably during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong (846-859 CE). He spent part of his life living as a religious hermit, practicing the Dao on Shaoshi Mountain near the Shaolin monastery."

    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",

  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "For instance, he said that Cao Cao's commentary was riddled with mistakes, and so he took it upon himself to write a new interpretation. Though I haven't managed to find any errors in Cao Cao's work, Li Quan's commentary is nonetheless very well written. The commentator Gu Lin lived during the Tang dynasty."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "During the reign of Emperor Dezong (779-805 CE) he served as an advisor to the military governor of Zhaoyi, a man named Li Baozhen. Li sent Gu Lin to bring a rebellious general, Wang Wujun, back in line, which he successfully did."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "As a result, he also managed to destroy Zhu Ci, another general who had rebelled and attempted to establish his own dynasty. Gu Lin was rewarded with noble titles: King of Wuwei Commandery, and Commander-General of the Shence Army. So, this commentator was himself a real military man, and perhaps because he was constantly busy fighting, his observations are short and succinct."

    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "We can only guess he didn't have much time for writing. Du You is a particularly special character. He served as prime minister of the Imperial court during the middle part of the Tang dynasty, and he lived through the catastrophic An-Shi rebellion that tore China apart."

  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "He compiled his research into an encyclopedic tome, known as The Tongdian. Unsurprisingly, Du You's commentary is hugely respected and is an authoritative source. Our next commentator, Du Mu, was Du You's grandson, and after Cao he was the most successful and influential of the reviewers. His output contains a large body of writings, many of which reference examples from various historical battles."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "In this book, I have used Du Mu's commentary more than any other. Du Mu was also an extremely famous poet of the Tang dynasty poetic elite, and memorizing his poems is still homework for students across China. Here's one of them:\n\nRaindrops pelt down on Qingming Festival,\nOn the road, miserable travellers' drooping heads\n\nMay I ask, where is the wine shop?"

    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "It's hard not to be a little arrogant when you're the scion of a wealthy noble house, and blessed with an outsized amount of talent on top of that. No matter how brilliantly Du Mu lectures on military theory, his manner can be overbearing."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "For example, a phrase that features regularly in his commentary is, 'Cao is mistaken!' This is invariably followed by Du Mu's own explanation of what he believe was actually happening. In any head-to-head comparison between Cao Cao and Du Mu, it would only be natural to trust Cao Cao more. He was, after all, the only one of the two who had actual experience leading troops into battle. But, this doesn't mean that Du Mu's different interpretations of things were entirely wrong."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Generally, when Du Mu says that Cao Cao's wrong about something, the two commentators were talking about different things. Du Mu was a better poet than Cao Cao, who also happened to be a famous poet in his own right."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "He was certainly very talented, but he couldn't necessarily understand what Cao Cao was talking about, since he had no battlefield experience and wasn't quite on the same level as Cao Cao academically. There is a Confucius quotation: 'Be always respectful, and you will never face humiliation.' This idea is also in the Confucian text, The Great Learning: ¡§The ruler's words going forth contrary to right, will come back to him in the same way3.\" The idea is that if you bad-mouth someone, someone else will inevitably bad-mouth you."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Because Du Mu made a habit of saying that Cao Cao was wrong, another writer naturally went out of his way to tell the world that actually it was Du Mu who was wrong. That writer was Chen Hao, the next of our 11 commentators. Chen Hao thought that Du Mu had muddied the waters by discrediting Cao Cao at almost every turn, and so he felt compelled to set the account straight. The words 'Du Mu is wrong, Cao Cao is right' appear often in his commentary, part of his attempt to restore order to academic discussion of Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Chen Hao lived towards the end of the Tang dynasty, and his views about earlier commentators are summarized in historical records: ¡§Chen Hao considered Lord Cao's commentary profound and cryptic, while he considered Du Mu's commentary broad and sweeping. Chen Hao wrote his commentary in order to moderate the gap between Cao and Du.\" Chen also respected the commentators who came before him as men of great wisdom, and made it his mission to carry their work forward. His thinking was: Sun Tzu has left us this remarkable book, but it's difficult for people to understand it through Cao Cao's commentary because it's just as brief and technical as the main text itself. On the other hand, he ventured, people might be misled by Du Mu's commentary, which although detailed and comprehensive is also undermined by sloppiness and even inaccuracies in some areas."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "So, Chen Hao decided to build on the foundation left by Cao Cao and Du Mu, and wrote a new commentary. Chinese historians have grouped together these three commentaries - by Cao Cao, Du Mu and Chen Hao - and given them a name: Commentaries of the Three Masters. By studying them together, students stand to gain deeper insight."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Five of the 11 commentators lived during the Tang dynasty: Li Quan, Gu Lin, Du You, Du Mu and Chen Hao. This high concentration is because China became very unstable during the second half of the Tang dynasty, after the An-Shi rebellion."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "There was war almost every year, and so scholars were preoccupied with studying military theory much more than usual. This explains why Du Mu, whose grandfather had been a prime minister, became interested in military issues even while he was making a name for himself as a great poet. In this sense, he was very much a product of his times."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "After the Tang dynasty, the dynasty most preoccupied with military matters was the Song dynasty. It started with a period of relative peace, but then a series of events put the country under constant military pressure. There was constant tumult, from the Tangut rebellion, started by Li Yuanhao's declaration of a rival 'Western Xia' dynasty in the northwest, to conflicts with minority ethnic groups in the north. As problems piled up, the Song court was short on both competent generals and experienced troops."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "What was to be done? Desperate, the dynasty's leaders turned to books in search of answers. The country devoted itself to studying the art of war, culminating in the government-compiled primer for military studies, called Seven Military Classics. The first of the seven classics was Sun Tzu's The Art of War, which is how it first became established as a classic text - thanks to the Song government. Against the backdrop of the Song dynasty's military problems, Wang Xi wrote a new commentary."

Although they were definitely wise, they and their writings belong to antiquity in many ways. I still had questions that I couldn't find a proper explanation for, so I began to search for commentaries by modern writers. There is no shortage of specialist commentaries about Sun Tzu's The Art of War, but most of them are concerned more with academic research than actual military studies. They are first and foremost works of scholarship, and they aren't concerned with war per se. When a writer writes about war, but is not motivated primarily by actual war, he ends up writing in a certain way, and about certain things - sometimes in a way that seems to actually move the discussion further away from the inherent subject matter. Eventually, I found a book titled, A Translation and Commentary of Sun Tzu's The Art of War4, written by Guo Huaruo and published by the Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House. This writer, Guo Huaruo, was a Lieutenant General in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China."

Someone else responds: 'At its core, it refers to the five factors, which are called: The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method; and Discipline.'

In the major Confucian text, The Doctrine of the Mean, while expounding its version of the Dao, heavy emphasis is laid on the idea of 'caution and fear.' This is the idea that one should be cautious and not take risks; that one should be scared of the unknown, and always be alert and constantly scrutinizing not only yourself but also anything you may have overlooked or don't know about. At this point, I think we've made it pretty clear that the idea of not fighting battles is a major motif in The Art of War."

This partly explains why the only biographical information we have about Sun Tzu's life is very vague, while other generals of the same time period, like Wu Zixu, left many a fabulous tale behind. Consider these words: ¡§Good fighters have neither a reputation for wisdom nor merit for courage, but excel in winning easy battles.\" When Sun Tzu wrote about 'victory,' he meant the kind of victory that is sealed in the temple while plans are being drawn, not the kind that's snatched from the enemy on the battlefield.

The word comes from the Qin convention of elevating a person by one grade within the hierarchy of nobility each time they cut off an enemy's head! This was a way of implanting the codes of reward and punishment into the very language people spoke - a person's head no longer just meant 'a person's head,' but 'one rank higher in the nobility.'

To achieve this, the ruler must widely share the fruits of victory, govern the people with appropriate policies, and not be stingy in handing out rewards and noble titles. Commentators from different eras used the same historical example to illustrate this line from Sun Tzu's The Art of War: The general Han Xin's choice during the wars following the collapse of the Qin dynasty to fight for Liu Bang (who went on to become the first Emperor of the Han dynasty) instead of his rival warlord, Xiang Yu."

He carefully selected his best troops and equipment - 1,300 war chariots, 13,000 war horses, 50,000 foot soldiers brave enough to charge the enemy lines head-on, as well as 100,000 archers - and he marched to war. Li employed the stratagem of 'luring the enemy in deep,' first sending a large number of nomadic herders with accompanying livestock out into the countryside. The Xiongnu sent a small force to intercept the nomads and steal their livestock, and Li Mu allowed them to 'win,' intentionally losing several thousand men to the Xiongnu. The Xiongnu were elated by their little victory, and their chieftain, Chanyu, decided to launch a full invasion with a much larger force. As the Xiongnu advanced, Li Mu spread his troops wide in an ambush formation, surrounding the invaders on two sides. With one stroke, Li eliminated 100,000 Xiongnu cavalry. The Xiongnu chieftain fled into the wilderness, while the victorious Li Mu took full advantage of the momentum his victory gave him to attack and destroy two other nomadic tribal confederations, the Chanlan and the Dong Hu, while also subjugating the Lin Hu. For more than ten years after this battle, the Xiongnu didn't once come near the borders of Zhao."

If you believe the historians, you'd think that what made Han Xin a great general was his craftiness and his cunning tricks, but would be a mistake to say that this is what war is all about. Great generals are just like CEOs - the fundamentals of their work consist of operations management. Operations management is why Han Xin once said that, while Liu Bang could not lead more than 100,000 soldiers with any effectiveness, Han Xin himself would take all the soldiers he could lay his hands on."

According to the story, after the dam was built, the water downriver was shallow enough for the enemy army to cross, but when they'd only crossed halfway, Han Xin had the sacks of earth torn down, effectively bursting the dam and drowning the enemy army. Zeng Guofan pointed out that it would be impossible to dam a large river just with a group of men throwing sacks of dirt in the water, and it would be even more impossible to instantly tear down such a dam. Who exactly was supposed to have done the demolition job, and how?"

Well, Sima Qian (a great historian of the Han dynasty) was after all a writer, too - there can be no doubt that some sensational and embellished sources must have figured in his research into the stories of Han Xin.\"\nThere aren't many stratagems, and they're all well-worn tools of the trade, familiar to commanders on either side of any conflict, all of whom have read the same military books.

Guan Yu was obsessed with capturing the Wei fortress of Fancheng, but at the same time he was wary of the potential threat posed by Eastern Wu. He feared that if he made moves to attack Fancheng, he would make himself vulnerable to attack from behind by Eastern Wu general Lu Meng. Because of this, Guan Yu left a large reserve force behind to defend Jingzhou. As for Cao Cao, he could see that Guan Yu was too powerful to fight, and was keen to stay away from him. Likewise, Lu Meng could see that Guan Yu held a strong position, and so spent his time making preparations. For Lu Meng to stand a chance of taking Jingzhou, he would have to make Guan Yu pull out his defensive forces. In other words, Jingzhou would have to pivot from a 'secure' situation to an 'exposed' one.

So, as far as the king was concerned, these rumors had been a great help; they even saved him the effort of working out which general to send out to replace Lian Po. Let's turn again to the wars between Liu Bang and Xiangyu following the collapse of the Qin dynasty. Liu Bang spent a year trapped by Xiang Yu in the city of Xinyang, cut off from outside help and supplies. Luckily, Liu Bang's advisor, Chen Ping, had a plan. He pointed out that Xiang Yu only had a handful of capable men giving him advice: Fan Zeng (whom Xiang Yu so respected that he called him his 'second father'), Zhong Limei, Long Qie and Zhou Yin. If a wedge could be driven between people in Xiang Yu's camp, these four men could be eliminated, and Xiang Yu would become much easier to deal with. Liu Bang gave Chen Ping 40,000 catties of gold, which he used to bribed a few of Xiang Yu's officers to spread rumors that Fan Zeng and Zhong Limei were dissatisfied that, despite doing more than anyone else for Xiang Yu, they hadn't got what they deserved: the title of 'king.'

One day, when a messenger from Xiang Yu visited Liu Bang's camp, Chen Ping ordered servants to lay out an exquisite spread of fine meats and wines for the messenger. He then asked the man: ¡§What instructions from Lord Fan Zeng?\" The messenger, perplexed, responded: ¡§I was sent by Xiang Yu, not Fan Zeng.\" Immediately, Chen Ping changed his tune. ¡§Oh! We thought you'd been sent by Fan Zeng!\" he said, and ordered the servants to take away the fine meats and wines, and ushered the messenger into another, much less comfortable room, where he was served cheap tea and plain rice.

Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.\"\n\nAnalysis:\nTo start off the new chapter, Waging War, here's some commentary from Cao Cao: ¡§If one desires to wage war, one must first calculate the expense, and determine whether grain can be seized from one's enemy.\"\nAnother comment, by Zhang Yu, addresses the logical order of steps to be taken: ¡§The calculations being in order, prepare for war: calculate, in the following order, the costs of readying chariots and horses, procuring good equipment, and transporting grain and fodder.\" You need to have a budget. The 'swift chariots' Sun Tzu refers to were war chariots, each pulled by four horses."

    "chapter": "Chapter Two",
    "content": "When Sun Tzu was alive, stirrups had not yet been invented, making it too precarious for men on horseback to fight at close quarters. This meant there were no horseback soldiers, only war chariots. Each war chariot would carry three armored soldiers, and was backed up by 72 foot soldiers following closely behind, according to The Methods of Sima. Ancient Chinese war chariots were used in more or less the same way as tanks in modern warfare. One war chariot represents 75 soldiers. In Chinese history books, a common phrase is 'a country of a thousand chariots,' which is actually a practical measure of a country's military might. In meant that the country in question possesses 1,000 war chariots, equaling 75,000 soldiers in total. Meanwhile, 'heavy chariots' refers to supply carts, which would be loaded with everything from food rations and cooking equipment to weapons, armor, clothes, etc. Each heavy chariot would carry 25 men: ten cooks, five attendants, five horse grooms, and five laborers whose job it was to chop wood and fetch water. With 1,000 heavy chariots, the number of extra men adds up to 25,000. Together with the men assigned to light chariots, this adds up to army of 100,000 men, also explaining the arithmetic behind 'a hundred thousand sets of armor.'\nThis is definitely a lot of men to account for, but then you have to wrap your head around somehow procuring 'provisions enough to carry them a thousand li!' Transporting food was a seriously important part of warfare in ancient China. For example, suppose you're planning an expedition to attack the Xiongnu."

One picul equals ten dou, and since Zhang Yu explains in his commentary that one picul is also equal to 120 jin (a commonly used unit in China today, about 0.5 kilograms), we can see that one dou equals 12 jin. One zhong, according to Du Mu, is equal to six piculs and four dou, or 778 jin. Let's calculate the basis of Sun Tzu's statement: ¡§One zhong of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own.\" Basically, you have to use 20 zhong of food in the process of having people transport one zhong of food to the front line.

Clearly, relying on human laborers and beasts of burden to transport food takes a long time, and it's very inefficient. There was similarly low efficiency in grain delivery when Han Wudi launched his conquest of the southwestern Yi people. He conscripted tens of thousands of people to run the transport convoys, and each picul of food delivered came at a cost of over a dozen zhong, an efficiency rate hovering near 1%. So, Sun Tzu's figure of 'one in twenty' was favourable in comparison."

On the ancient Chinese battlefield, it went without saying that your charioteers would try to pilfer the enemy's chariots, your cavalry would try to pilfer the enemy's cavalry, and your infantry would try to pilfer the enemy's infantry. When General Wu Qi did battle against a Qin army, he told his three armies: ¡§Though we may destroy the enemy, any victory we might gain would be meritless unless our chariots take from their chariots, our cavalry take from their cavalry, and our infantry take from their infantry!\" This is one of the criteria for success in war; it's not enough just to kill the enemy and win the day.

When Qin attacked Chu's alliance with Qi, shouldn't it have been obvious that this also represented an attack against Qi; an attack on its own alliance with Chu? If your teammate acts like a fool, that doesn't mean that you should also act like a fool. When Chu attacked Qin, Qi could have come to their former ally's aid.

Du Mu advises that you should use your army to attack either the enemy's weakest point, or attack him where you know he will be unable to resist immediately coming to the rescue. In this way, you can decrease the number of troops available to him, and consolidate your initial two-to-one advantage."

Cao Cao's commentary is simpler: ¡§If attacking one with two, then use one part as your mainstay, and the other part as the auxiliary force.\" Cao Cao's interpretation of Sun Tzu is different; he reads it as an imperative to divide your own army. Du Mu argues that the decision to split your army into a main force and an auxiliary force has nothing to do with the relative number of troops commanded by you and your enemy."

So, Cao Cao was right too. Cao Cao went into more detail as well, spelling out how many troops should be allocated for different functions. This topic actually constitutes a whole branch of the art of war, known as 'the art of division.' A book by Ming dynasty strategist Liu Bowen, Extraordinary Strategies of a Hundred Battles, contains a chapter devoted to the art of division. Here's an excerpt:\n¡§When fighting your enemy, if my forces are numerous and the enemy's few, then I ought to select an open expanse as the site where I will defeat him."

    "chapter": "Chapter Three",
    "content": "If my forces are five times more numerous than the enemy's, then I ought to allocate three fifths of my soldiers to be the main force, with the remaining two fifths as an auxiliary force. If my forces are three times more numerous than the enemy's, then I ought to allocate two thirds of my soldiers to be the main force, with the remaining one third as an auxiliary force. This can be called 'blocking him in the front with one half of my forces, while attacking his rear with the other half.' The past master10 says: 'if you do not divide when you ought to divide, you are tying your own hands.'\"\nCao Cao's ¡§If attacking one with two, then use one part as your main force, and the other part as the auxiliary force\" could just as well be added to the text above. In this chapter, the concept of 'main forces and auxiliary forces' has repeatedly popped up. In fact, it comes from perhaps the most famous line (in China) of Sun Tzu's The Art of War: ¡§Use the regular to engage the enemy, and the irregular to defeat him.\" Here, 'irregular' doesn't refer to anything strange or odd, despite the fact that the Chinese character used in the original text usually means 'extraordinary,' or even 'queer.' It simply means 'forces kept in reserve.' While the main forces get the fight started, the commander watches from his command center, waiting for the crucial moment. Then, he orders his reserves to spring into action, sealing his victory."

Cao Cao comments: ¡§If the number of one's force are equivalent to the enemy's, then the skillful general lays an ambush with his irregular troops, and in this way secures victory.\" So, once again it comes back to a division of duties between 'regular and irregular troops.' The regular troops challenge the enemy head-on, while the irregular troops prepare an ambush. Though Cao Cao doesn't spell out here what proportion of troops should be allocated for 'regular' and 'irregular' roles, history tells us that in most cases when generals used this 'lure and ambush' tactic, the main force was actually smaller than the auxiliary force. ¡§If slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy.\"\n\nIf you have fewer troops than the enemy, don't leave your defensive position."

To illustrate his point, Du Mu cites the example set by Han dynasty general Zhou Yafu. When Zhou was stationed in Xiliu, the Emperor, Han Wendi, made an inspection tour of his forces, intending to show his appreciation to the soldiers. At every camp the Emperor visited, the gate guards let him pass as soon as they saw him, and the commanding officers rushed out to greet him. But Zhou Yafu's camp was different. When Han Wendi arrived, he was stopped by the guards and told to wait while someone went to inform Zhou Yajun that he'd arrived. The guards told the Emperor that they took orders from no one except their general, not even from the Son of Heaven. The Emperor waited for a good while before he was allowed in. Zhou Yafu didn't come out to greet him, but just gave a simple message for his men to relay to Han Wendi: ¡§Please enter.\" Zhou even told the emperor that his carriage was not permitted to move too quickly while inside the camp, per military rules.

For example, during the Tang dynasty's An Lushan Rebellion, Tang general Geshu Han was holding a strong defensive position at Tongguan Pass, and his situation appeared to be improving after half a year of refusing to be drawn out of his fortress and into a pitched battle. Despite this, Emperor Xuanzong forced Geshu Han to go out and fight."

He could not accept the fact that An Lushan had rebelled against him, let alone the possibility that the rebel general could defeat him. That's why Xuanzong executed his two best generals, Feng Changqing and Gao Xianzhi, who had lost battles against the rebels. Xuanzong's behavior was an act of self-sabotage. Now that he could see the tide was turning in his favor at Tongguan Pass, Xuanzong was anxious to destroy An Lushan as soon as possible, like waving away an unpleasant smell. Another reason was that Emperor Xuanzong's advisor, Yang Guozhong, was fanning the flames."

Fu Jian was himself not purely Han Chinese, and it's unlikely that people of ethnic minority background would believe it was dangerous to attack someone just because they were 'pure' Han Chinese.

His sister became a favorite concubine of Fu Jian, and Murong himself became a male concubine, so brother and sister both were moved into the imperial harem. Later in life, Murong Chong yearned to reestablish his old kingdom, but he ended up serving in Fu Jian's army. When Fu Jian saw him one day at the front, the old Emperor was overcome with emotion, and had a servant take a brocaded gown over to Murong Chong.

Zhang Yu also takes a shot at explaining the idea of 'formation.' He said the following: ¡§It is the shape of two armies, one attacking and the other defending. When it is hidden within, then the enemy cannot determine what it is; when it is visible from outside, then the enemy can infiltrate through the cracks.\" \nBoth sides do all that they can to not allow the enemy to probe their formation."

The Han dynasty scholar-official Xun Yue wrote about 'formation' and 'energy' in the same passage:\n¡§There are three essentials in the art of establishing policies and obtaining victory: 1) Formation; 2) Force; 3) Circumstances.

Xun Yue also said that once the wheels are in motion, you need to rely on force. This isn't wrong, but Sun Tzu discusses the topic in much more detail in Chapter five. Finally, Xun Yue also mentioned 'circumstances.' When he talks about 'one's will,' he's referring to the commander-in-chief's willpower, but also to his men's morale, and whether or not it's 'in the realm of possibility.' In The Art of War, 'circumstances' are categorized as part of 'force,' so Xun Yue's 'three essentials' are actually only two: 'formation' and 'force.'\nOnce you've got your head around these two topics, the whole process of fighting and winning battles boils down to the two processes of 'winning formation' and 'winning force.' Now, let's start reading through Chapter Four: Formation, which is all about winning through the use of 'formations.'\n\n¡§The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.

Then, they would wait for the right time and opportunity to defeat their enemy.

We generally run into problems when our focus is always on fighting, and not winning; when we want to use some clever idea to win quickly. Because we think like this, we get into fights without making sure to win first, which in turn leads to fighting against bad odds. Sun Tzu said: ¡§The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself. Thus, the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy. Hence the saying: One may know how to obtain victory without being able to achieve it. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking displays a superabundance of strength.

One often-quoted explanation comes from the Han dynasty scholar-official, Xun Yue:\n¡§There are three essentials in the art of establishing policies and obtaining victory: 1) Formation; 2) Energy; 3) Circumstances.

Circumstances are about whether or not, in truth, one's will is within the realm of possibility. Thus, the fact that results differ even when policies and events are the same is because of differences in the use of these three arts.\"\nWhile this is an accurate analysis, Xun Yue is talking about a different kind of 'energy' than that described in Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Xun Yue understands 'energy' as being about responding to events as they develop, following whatever direction offers advantage. For Sun Tzu, 'energy' is something artificial, something that people can create, like a kind of 'momentum.'\nOnce you've built this momentum, you exploit it, using its artificial force to propel your team forward, or even to call upon the forces of nature to do your bidding. The main point that Sun Tzu emphasizes is building momentum as a way to influence people mentally, to exert force on their will. This is why, in The Art of War, the idea of 'circumstances'- which Xun Yue separates from 'formation' and 'force' - falls under the broader category of 'energy.' So, if you build the right kind of momentum, it doesn't matter what the circumstances are. Even if the people you're trying to influence don't have the will to do what you want, once you apply force to them, one way or another they'll have to do what you want!"

Fighting with a large army under your command is no different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.\"\n\nManaging a lot of people is the same managing only a few, because of this idea of 'dividing up their numbers,' also known as 'staffing structure.'

It says this: ¡§By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.\" Cao Cao comments: ¡§'The marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions' is the organizing of units, and it is also the organizing of flags and pennants, and of drums.\" Here, 'the organizing of units' corresponds with 'dividing numbers,' and 'flags, pennants and drums' corresponds with 'signs and signals.'\nIn ancient Chinese armies, the smallest fighting unit was called a wu, and contained five soldiers. The ancient word wu has become part of modern Chinese words, such as: duiwu, meaning 'a squad,' and 'ru dui,' meaning 'to join the military.' Twenty wu - 100 soldiers - makes a zu, which is more or less the same as a 'company' in the modern military."

In the 20th century, Chinese Communist Party General Lin Biao invented his 'three three's system,' making three the smallest military unit instead of five, and changing all the larger units into multiples of three. Lin Biao named the smallest unit a small battle group. Three small battle groups made up a battle squad, three battle squads made up a war platoon, three war platoons made up a company, three companies made up a battalion, three battalions made up a regiment, and three regiments made up a division. Lin Biao's 'three three's system' was his own, unique invention, different from both the American regimental system and the former Soviet Union's division-based system.

This is the meaning of 'dividing their numbers,' and of the dictate that 'Fighting with a large army under your command is no different from fighting with a small one.' Lin Biao was able to command the Fourth Field Army as easily and nimbly as a three-man small battle group. ¡§Fighting with a large army under your command is no different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.\"\n\nWhat is the key to being able to command a large army on the battlefield in the same way as a much smaller force?"

After the battle, Han Xin met with Lord Guangwu, and said: ¡§If your lord had the sense to use your scheme, I would now be your prisoner.\" But Han Xin was just being polite; he never would have allowed himself to be taken prisoner, because if the Zhao army had decided to use Lord Guangwu's plan, he wouldn't have come. He either would have devised a different route to victory, or decided to wait and bide his time, in honor of the principle: 'Win first, fight later.' If you're not going to win, you shouldn't start a fight."

When he'd marched within 30 li of Jingxing Pass under the cover of night, he put together an auxiliary unit of 2,000 men and divided up different tasks. At first light the next morning, Han Xin's army emerged from Jingxing Pass and arranged a force of 10,000 soldiers with their backs to the river. When the Zhao troops saw this, they laughed loudly. They'd never seen an army lined up like this before, and it seemed obvious that they'd be able to force their enemy into the water with a single charge. The Han troops were also aware of this possibility, and knew that, with their backs to the river and no way out, their only option was to fight to the death. This story is actually the origin of another modern Chinese idiom: 'To fight with one's back to the water.'\nHan Xin had already dispatched his auxiliary forces the night before. Once his 10,000-strong main force was in position by the river, he personally led his ceremonial guard of honor out of Jingxing Pass, and set up his battle flags, drums and ceremonial weapons with much pageantry and bravado."

At this stage, Han Xin's army was no longer configured as two auxiliary forces and one regular, but had morphed into one main force and one irregular. His personal unit had merged with the force stationed by the river, becoming the new main force.

In this final stage, what kind of interchange was there between Han Xin's regular and auxiliary forces? The 2,000 irregular troops became the main force, because they were now on the offensive, while the part of Han Xin's army that was not on the offensive became the auxiliary force. With his main force attacking the enemy camp, the Zhao began to fall back, defeated."

In this battle, we've seen how the concepts of 'the regular and the irregular' are used. Han Xin was able to maintain separate regular and auxiliary forces through the whole battle, while the Zhao army ended up without an auxiliary force. If the Zhao leaders had kept 2,000 men in camp as reserves, Han Xin's 2,000-strong auxiliary force wouldn't have been able to get past them.

  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "The newly combined Han force then engaged the enemy, making it the new main force. The second switch was when the Zhao forces attacked with all the troops they had, emptying their camp in the process. Then, Han Xin's auxiliary force of 2,000 cavalry charged into the deserted enemy camp and switched the flags, effectively becoming the new main force. Shortly after, the enemy gave up the fight with the Han men by the river, turned back and tried to retake their camp. At this point, the large riverside force under Han Xin's personal command suddenly switched roles and became the auxiliary force. In other words, they were no longer part of the main battle."

  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "There are also main and auxiliary forces at play on a much smaller level, like between individual squads and companies. In fact, every unit involved in a battle is wrapped up in 'the regular and the irregular.' From a micro perspective, 'the regular and the irregular' are the building blocks of battle tactics. They're why armies don't swarm forward like a hive of angry, disorganized bees, but instead work in regimented coordination, operating according to strict timing. This is the real reason why Sun Tzu said that the changes between 'the regular and the irregular' are truly infinite: you could never run out of new combinations.

We can get a good understanding of how 'the regular and the irregular' are used by looking at a soccer match as an example.

Whenever the ball is passed, the roles switch."

Meanwhile, his enemy, the Jin commander, Xie Xuan, had only 80,000 men. Xie Xuan sent a messenger to Fu Jian, to tell him to line his troops up by the river and make a little space by moving back, and that Xie Xuan would then cross the river with his army so they could get the fighting started.

Half of those he'd put in charge of his troops were like Zhu Xu: people with very different intentions than his own. Before the Battle of Fei River, Fu Jian sent Zhu Xu to try to persuade the Eastern Jin leader Xie Shi to surrender. This was Zhu Xu's big chance. When he met with Xie Shi, he told him that although it was claimed that the Former Qin army numbered 800,000 men, not all of them had yet been assembled.

In this instance, 'prompt' doesn't only mean being quick about doing something, but also minimizing the distance that has to be crossed when you act.

Show the enemy disorder where in reality there is order; show fear where there is courage, and weakness where there is strength. The reason why 'disorder comes from order' is that you must manage your army with both transparency and tight discipline if you're going to have any chance of effectively producing an illusion of chaos on the surface while still maintaining perfect order. The reason why 'fear comes from courage' is that it takes extraordinary courage to act scared enough to suck the enemy in. Finally, the reason why 'weakness comes from strength' is that you need your army to be exceptionally strong before you can feel confident enough to make a show of weakness and lure the enemy into launching an all-out attack on you."

The rebel army attacked swiftly, heading straight for the southeastern section of the city walls, but Zhou Yafu made sure to position a large part of his troops near the northwestern section of the walls. Before long, the rebel army did indeed send its best troops to attack from the northwest. However, because Zhou Yafu had set up strong defenses, the rebels couldn't break through."

In Waging War, the second chapter of The Art of War, he also says: ¡§Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter (god in charge) of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril.\" The general who knows his men is like a god to the people of his country, and he holds their fates in his hand; what he does will decide whether they live or die.

When Zhang Xiu saw that Cao Cao was pulling back, he coordinated with the army of his ally, Liu Biao, and attacked Cao Cao from either side, in a pincer movement. Under Cao Cao's expert direction, his forces delivered a crushing defeat to Liu Biao's and Zhang Xiu's two armies, and then rapidly withdrew. Everything went exactly as Cao Cao had planned, except for one thing: he hadn't accounted for a certain, extremely talented adviser who was working for Zhang Xiu, a man named Jia Xu.

Earlier in the book, when we were looking at 'dividing numbers,' we took a first look at Lin Biao's 'Three three's' organizational system.

Then, you can wipe out his forces, or leave one open direction for him to run, and wipe him out while he retreats. To understand the 'Four swifts and one slow,' we should first look at the 'one slow.' It is about moving slowly as you launch your general offensive, and not making any moves unless you're fully ready.

As Cao Cao pondered the situation, drawing on the lessons of The Art of War, he determined that since he hadn't intended to fight a battle that day - and if he hadn't run into Zhao Yun, he would never have gone to his camp - it was possible that this was a plan made by Zhao Yun."

As mentioned earlier, Gong Sunxiao sent a vanguard force of a few tens of thousands of troops to guard the River Liao. He personally commanded the main force, which was to act as a relief force for the vanguard, thus blocking Sima Yi's forward progress from a distance of several dozen li. Sima Yi used part of his army to pin down the enemy, and then quietly led an elite force around the enemy lines, across the River Liao, and directly to Gong Sunxiao's powerbase, the city of Rangping, which he then besieged. This is the stratagem of 'Forcing him to move by attacking a place where he is bound to come to the rescue; to leave him with no option but to fight, despite having strong defensive fortifications.' Gong Sunxiao was forced to move, to protect Rangping, and while on the road, he was defeated three times by Sima Yi's forces. He eventually retreated behind Rangping's city walls, where he took up a defensive position. This is what it means to 'surround an enemy position in order to destroy his relief force; know on what day and in what location the battle will be fought.'\nWhen Sima Yi arrived in Liaodong, it was the seventh month of the year - the beginning of the wet season. Once the rains started, they didn't stop for a whole month, so Sima Yi hunkered down with his army and didn't move."

This uncertainty is intentional - it's about selling the enemy a deceptive impression, just like Emperor Taizong meant when he said: ¡§Use a multitude of diverse methods to fool one's foe.\" The point is to come up with a way, any way, to trick the enemy into slipping up and making an error of judgment. So, 'In making tactical dispositions, the highest excellence you can attain,' and the absolute best way to show the enemy your form is to make your form infinitely variable, to the point that your army becomes 'without form.'

But, Han Xin also had a force of 2,000 cavalry, which he used to attack the Zhao camp, tear down the Zhao banners, and replace them with their own Han banners.

    "content": "As a result, it is not they who move the enemy where they will, but the enemy who moves them. What do you make of this problem?\"\nDuke Li of Wei replied: ¡§To perceive weak points and strong, one must first understand 'the main and the auxiliary.' Most military leaders do not know how to use a main force as an auxiliary force and vice versa, so how could they properly identify when a strong point is a weak point, and a weak point is a strong point? The main and the auxiliary are used to manipulate the enemy's weak and strong points - where the enemy is strong, I must use my main force; where the enemy is weak, I must use my auxiliary force. Without an understanding of the usages of the main and the auxiliary, then even if one is able to perceive the enemy's weak and strong points, one will still be unable to attack them.\"\nThen, Emperor Taizong said: ¡§When I use my auxiliary force as my main force, my enemy thinks that I am using my auxiliary force, when in fact it is my main force with which I am striking him. Or, the enemy thinks I am using my main force, when in fact it is my auxiliary force with which I am striking him. Thus, the enemy is in a constant position of weakness, while I am in a constant position of strength.\"\nThis passage ends with a summary by Duke Li of Wei: ¡§Countless words have been written on this subject, but essentially, the message never ventures beyond this idea: 'Manipulate your foe, and do not allow yourself to be manipulated.'\"\nThe duke's summary forms a pair with the principle of winning by responding to your enemy's situation. When the idea of manipulating your foe while avoiding being manipulated yourself is taken to an extreme, it becomes: 'I don't care what your deal is; I only care what my deal is.' Above all else, it's about not being manipulated by your enemy, not giving him any opportunities and forcing him to endure a long wait."

Then, in Formations and Energy, we talked about various situations involving formations and energy, and about organizing armies, deploying troops, and how to come to decisions.

Zhao She knew that this officer was a good man, but this was exactly what he'd been waiting for: a good man to come to him and offer his head on a platter. This was part of his plan to 'turn the circuitous into the direct.' So, he immediately ordered that the officer be taken outside and beheaded.

Meanwhile, the moment Zhao She had seen off the Qin spy, he ordered his army to pack up their armor, along with a few, light pieces of equipment and supplies, and he set off. Moving quickly, they arrived safely at Yuyu after two days and one night's march, without running into a single ambush or even the slightest whiff of resistance. Zhao She didn't head straight for Yuyu, but stopped about 50 li shy of the city, and set up camp in a location he'd selected specially for its good terrain. At this point, another of his officers, a man named Xu Li, stepped forward and put his neck on the line by suggesting to Zhao She: ¡§Victory will surely belong to whoever holds the northern mountains.\" Zhao She immediately agreed with the man, and sent 10,000 troops to set up a position at the highest point in the northern mountains.

  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Seven",
    "content": "But Zhao She already held the best terrain, so he won a major victory over the Qin army, resulting in the end of the Qin siege of Yuyu. The story of this battle is a particularly gripping one. Traveling unarmored, and with only light supplies, is a very dangerous move. After a forced march lasting two days and a night, without any supply wagons, the Zhao army had moved far away from its rear support system, and the soldiers would have been exhausted. If Zhao She had rushed straight into a confrontation with the Qin army under Yuyu's city walls, without pausing for a rest, he likely would have ended up as a Qin prisoner. Zhao She's stroke of genius lay in the fact that he camped 50 li outside of Yuyu, set up a proper defensive line and fortifications, and dug in, waiting for the Qin army to come to him. In doing this, he was putting into practice a key lesson from Weak Points and Strong: ¡§Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will be exhausted.\" If one of the two sides was exhausted, it was definitely the Zhao troops - they would have been utterly spent after their forced march. But instead of heading straight for Yuyu, they pulled up 50 li short, meaning that the Qin soldiers basically had to run a marathon to get to them, wearing themselves out in the process. This turned the tables - the Zhao troops rested up while they waited for their enemies to tire themselves out on the road to the battlefield. Also in the chapter on Weak Points and Strong, we read how Duke Li of Wei said that in all the thousands of pages written about the art of war, there is nothing that isn't essentially saying: 'Manipulate your foe, and do not allow yourself to be manipulated.' At first, the Qin army had everything planned out. They thought they were manipulating Zhao She, because they'd set up strong, mutually reinforcing positions at Wu'an and Yuyu, and planned to use the stratagem of besieging a city with the main purpose of drawing in an enemy relief force, under Zhao She's command, and destroying it on the road."

When you attack, be as fast as the wind, and when you retreat, leave no trace. Cao Cao adds on an extra meaning, which is that you should 'strike at emptiness.'

This meant that no matter what kind of attack Takeda Shingen's enemies might try, his troops never wavered, never left their position in the army's battle lines, and never allowed the enemy to affect them.

    "content": "So, the genius of his mock retreat was the fact that it was actually very real. He couldn't win, and that made his fake withdrawal all the more convincing. As Han Xin retreated, he started to lay out his baited hooks: his personal banner, his ceremonial weapons, his war drums, and so on. All of these items would be highly valuable to the Zhao troops; whoever got hold of Han Xin's personal banner would be sure to receive rich rewards. And so, the entire Zhao army poured out of the gates of their camp, falling over themselves in their rush to grab the treasure and bite on Han Xin's hook. The Zhao army broke two of Sun Tzu's rules: 'Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight' and 'Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy.' Meanwhile, in front of the massed Zhao soldiers, Han Xin's unit retreated to the riverbank, joined forces with the 10,000 men he'd stationed there earlier, and then charged back towards the Zhao army. From behind the Zhao lines, Han Xin's 2,000-strong auxiliary cavalry force rode into the Zhao camp and captured it, leaving the Zhao army facing a powerful enemy to their front, and suddenly without a base to retreat to."

The Qin army sent out a detachment of troops to act as bait, and then pretended to withdraw in defeat. Zhao Kuo immediately chased after them with his entire army. The Qin men drew Zhao Kuo to the main Qin force's position at a place called Changbi, where they Qin army was waiting for them. The Qin commander was using principles from The Art of War: ¡§Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will be exhausted,\" as well as ¡§Knowing the time and place of the battle\" and ¡§By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord.\" The Qin generals knew that the outcome of the battle would be decided at Changbi, so that's where they set themselves up to lure Zhao Kuo to them. Zhao Kuo was completely in the dark about this. ¡§The Regular May Be Used for Joining Battle, but The irregular Will Be Needed in Order to Secure Victory.\"\n\nThe Qin army started the battle by using its 'bait troops' as their main (regular) force, while the main army stationed at Changbi served as the auxiliary (irregular) force. When Zhao Kuo arrived at Changbi, the Qin bait troops merged with the bulk of the Qin army, forming a new main force."

Next, General Bai Qi sent 5,000 elite cavalry soldiers to the Zhao camp, to pin down the small Zhao force that had been left behind to guard it. Now, all of the Zhao food resupply routes were cut off, and the Zhao army was completely immobilized. Surrounded, Zhao Kuo's only option was to build defensive fortifications and wait to be rescued."

  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Seven",
    "content": "The answer is that he was too self-confident. Newborn calves aren't scared of tigers, but that doesn't mean a tiger won't eat them.

However, this misses the point."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Seven",
    "content": "The essence of Zhao Kuo's problem was that just because someone has read all of the books on the art of war and is deeply familiar with them, that isn't the same as actually understanding the art of war. There's a saying in Chinese: 'Even if you've never eaten pork, you've seen a pig running, haven't you?'

    "chapter": "Chapter Seven",
    "content": "Even if he was going to die, he had to at least go out fighting! But why? Let's take a look at how this war started. It began when the state of Qin attacked the state of Han. The Qin army was too strong for the Han forces to deal with, so they sued for peace, and offered some land to the Qin if they would call off their attack. That land was the Commandery of Shangdang. But the Han official in command of Shangdang Commandery, Feng Ting, wasn't willing to take orders from the Qin authorities, so he decided to make his own offer. He announced that he was bequeathing Shangdang Commandery to the King of Zhao. The King of Zhao, being greedy by nature, was delighted, and immediately sent soldiers to occupy Shangdang. You could describe this move as 'stealing food from the tiger's mouth.'\nThere was no way the King of Qin would sit idly by after the King of Zhao had stolen his new land from under his nose, and he turned the Qin war machine toward Shangdang. Of course, the small detachment of Zhao soldiers sent to take possession of Shangdang was no match for the Qin army."

What he didn't realize was that making changes isn't the same thing as solving a problem, or that making the wrong change can even make the situation worse. As far as the King of Zhao was concerned, if Lian Po couldn't fight, it went without saying that none of the other old generals would be able to, either.

Perhaps it's really about saying things like, 'Well, I think what they said there is obviously wrong.'\nWanting only to win is a very serious problem that can derail a person's studies.

The second point that's regularly questioned in discussions is the line: ¡§Though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.\" When you look at this line in the context of the text that comes before and after, its meaning is as clear as day. ¡§It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide the army12 into two. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.\"\nIf you can win, go ahead and fight. If you can't win, then run. If you only have a 'small force,' but you insist on being 'obstinate'- meaning that you refuse to run away - you're going to be captured by the enemy.

He argues that the line means: if you can beat the enemy, all his treasure and gear goes straight to you, regardless of how carefully he's locked it up and hidden it away! He then quotes a passage from the classic Daoist text, Zhuangzi, to prove his point: ¡§Zhuangzi said: 'If one would like to ensure that thieves come groping into your bags and rifling through your cupboards, and you want to make the right preparations, then you must lock up your things as tightly and securely as you can.'\"\nAs soon as the distinguished professor's audience hears the Zhuangzi quotation, they're blown away: 'Wow!"

Liu was defeated and his army destroyed at a battle by the Yuan River. The next year, a respected senior general, Li Song, and Ma Cheng, governor of Zhongshan, were sent out into the field, but still the Han army couldn't make positive gains. Ma Yuan then asked for permission to lead an army out, but Emperor Guangwu refused, out of concern that Ma Yuan was too old. But Ma Yuan protested: ¡§Your servant is still capable of donning armor and mounting a horse.\" So, Emperor Guangwu ordered him to do a test ride on a horse. Ma Yuan jumped into the saddle, and turned to look at the Emperor, eager to show he still had what it takes.

Once he entered Nanjing, he'd have the political capital to declare himself Emperor, and once he'd done that, all the government officials and court politicians would be forced to choose a side. The Zhengde Emperor, who was in power at the time, was laughably unsuited to be the 'Son of Heaven,' so the Prince of Ning wasn't lacking for opportunity. Wang Yangming, taking advantage of the fact that the Prince of Ning's stronghold city, Nanchang, was undefended, marched in and took it, gambling that the Prince of Ning would withdraw his army and attempt to take back Nanchang.

He never made it there - he was captured by Wang Yangming when he was only half-way back, at Poyang Lake. The Prince of Ning was inspired to launch his rebellion partly by the earlier success of Zhu Kang, who became Emperor Chengzu of the Ming dynasty. But Zhu Kang's strategy was precisely that 'there are towns which must not be besieged.' At the start of Zhu Kang's uprising, he spent a lot of time stuck in stalemate. He was mostly fighting in Hebei and Shandong Provinces, and although his army (the Yan army) won slightly more than they lost, he suffered heavy casualties, while the imperial army had a massive pool of manpower to call upon. If the imperial commanders could drag the conflict out, Zhu Kang would be unable to get the better of them. Later in the war, Zhu Kang got word from an imperial court eunuch in his service that Nanjing was poorly defended. So, he changed his whole strategy, drew up a large army, and personally led it directly to Nanjing. He fought his way to Yangzhou, at which point an imperial naval commander named Chen Xuan surrendered to Zhu Kang, handing him a fleet. He crossed the Yangzi River, made his way down to Zhenjiang, and then straight to Nanjing, where Zhu Hui, Prince of Gu, and Li Jinglong opened the Jinchuan gate and surrendered.

While the lands of Wu were unguarded, he launched a sudden attack, during which he killed the crown prince. Several years later, the state of Wu was obliterated by Yue, and Fuchai killed himself.

Zhucheng is on the north bank; it has no hinterland upon which to rely, and it is menaced by barbarians from outside. Lusting after the profit to be gained from Zhucheng will not only lead us into a place that is impossible to defend, but it will also incite barbarians to come.

Geshu Han had already seen two prominent imperial generals meet this very fate at the hands of Emperor Xuanzong: Gao Xianzhi and Feng Changqing, both staunch pillars of the state. And so, Geshu Han came shaking and sobbing out of his fortress, leading the Tang army into battle. He lost, badly.

But, he halted his army with thirty li of road left before reaching the city of Handan, set up camp and fortified his position. Pretending he had no intention of moving any closer to the enemy, he circulated an order through his army: ¡§Any man who offers unsolicited suggestions regarding military matters shall be executed!\"\nMeanwhile, as the Qin army carried on its siege of Yuyu, a secondary force was formed to hold off the Zhao army and prevent it from reaching the city.

Zheng Guo designed a huge irrigation project for Qin, which would divert the Jing River a distance of over 300 li and into the city of Luoyang. But while the project was under construction, the Han king's plot was exposed. The Qin king wanted to kill Zheng Guo, but the engineer protested: ¡§It's true that, at first, the Han King wanted me to work as his agent, but this irrigation project won't do anything for Han apart from giving it a few years of grace. Meanwhile, this project is a great achievement of the state of Qin, one that will endure for generations.\" The Qin king's officials could see the sense in Zheng Guo's words, so he was allowed to continue overseeing the irrigation project.

Luo Yi attacked precisely when half of the enemy troops had crossed, and inflicted a massive defeat.

Guo Huai didn't want a fight with Liu Bei, and he knew exactly what to do: according to the art of war, if you don't want to fight, you should deploy at the river's edge so as to block the enemy from crossing. But Guo Huai knew that Liu Bei was familiar with this tactic, meaning that if he followed the art of war and lined up by the river, Liu Bei would recognize this as a sign that Guo Huai was weak, reluctant to fight, and would then do the exact opposite of what Guo Huai wanted, crossing the river and attacking. Then, there would be no guarantee that Guo Huai's limited battle capabilities would be able to hold off the enemy. But, if Guo Huai chose to form up at a distance from the river, then according to the art of war, Liu Bei should take this as a sign that Guo Huai had a powerful enough army to feel confident, that he wanted to fight, and that if Liu Bei tried to cross, Guo Huai would attack before all his forces reached the far side.

Meanwhile, Zi Shang had the same idea: wanting to lure the Jin army across the river, he also pulled his army back and set up camp away from the river. Both generals were thinking in exactly the same way, so neither was fooled by the other's plan."

The two scoundrels made their way to the enemy camp, and instead of trying to build an alliance, they challenged the Chu leaders to fight. After the two men set out, another Jin general, Xi Ke, said: ¡§Those two are angry about the past.

So, how can one of them mean that the enemy wants to fight, while the other one means they want peace? The key is that in the earlier line: 'humble words' come together with 'increased preparations.' The enemy is actually cranking up their preparations for war.

There is no consistency among the officers and the soldiers; this is what it means to speak of 'a commander who has no long-standing advisors.' When he lines up his soldiers, the lines are slovenly and uneven; this is what it means to speak of 'the soldiery lacking control.' When a general is like this, disorganization follows.\"\n\nA general who 'is weak and not strict' has no authority or moral force.

The Han military men had their 'three rivers, valiant swordsmen and prodigies,' the Wu generals called them 'problem-solvers,' the Qi generals called them 'fate-fixers,' and the Tang generals called them 'leapers and shakers.'

A million men who do not obey orders are worth less than ten thousand with the will to fight; ten thousand men who do not obey orders are worth less than a hundred imbued with powerful energy.

Wang Shichong was relentless, and the conflict left both sides utterly exhausted. It was then that Dou Jiande began to march with a massive army of 100,000 men to rescue Wang Shichong.

They included two ubermensch warriors - Yuchi Jingde and himself - and went out again to pick another fight. Li Shimin said to Yuchi Jingde: ¡§With my bow, and your spear, not even a thousand armed men could touch us!\" The two of them, along with their four handpicked cavalrymen, headed straight for Dou Jiande's main camp and lured several thousand enemy troops into the pre-assigned ambush location, where Li's forces won a great victory.

In fact, Du Mu was saying that if the enemy has gotten ahead of you, you should chase after him, and try to get ahead, so you can be the first to arrive at the contentious ground. Du Mu was not saying that in this scenario the enemy has already occupied the contentious ground.

Sun Tzu probably wasn't saying that after you've taken the contentious ground you should come up behind the enemy and strike their rear. Du You comments: ¡§With favourable terrain ahead, one should enter into it from behind. On contentious ground, victory belongs to whoever occupies it first, and defeat falls to whoever fails to do so. Therefore, bring your rear units close after the remainder of your forces so that the different parts of your army remain connected.\" The first part of what Du You said was right - the nature of contentious ground is that whoever occupies it first will win, and the other side will lose. That's exactly why it's called 'contentious ground.' This makes what you do after you hold the contentious ground, or whether you should hit the enemy with a sneak attack from behind, a moot point. But, the second part of Du You's comment - ¡§Therefore, bring your rear units close after the remainder of your forces so that the different parts of your army are connected\" - shows that he also didn't understand the original text. Does he want the rear units to catch up and link together with the forward units so that the army doesn't fall apart? Zhang Yu doubles down on Du You's view: ¡§In contentious ground speed is a commodity of the highest value; it is not acceptable for your forward units to move quickly ahead while your rear units fail to keep up. Therefore, you should quickly move your rear units forward so that the head and tail of your army arrive together.\" So, Zhang Yu is interpreting the 'rear' from Sun Tzu's original text to mean not the enemy's rear, but your own rear. He's saying you shouldn't get yourself in a situation where your forward units make it to the contentious ground, but your rear units can't keep up."

There's a relation between trust and not doubting - trust is the reason, and soldiers who never doubt you is the objective. So, the best course of action is to not give your soldiers the choice between trusting and not trusting; go straight to making sure they never doubt you.

Chen Qingzhi led his men into action under the cover of night, knocked out four of the enemy camps, and secured the surrender of the Guoyang garrison commander, Wang Wei.

There's a well-known phrase in Chinese, 'Poor man come; here's food,' which means food that is donated with contempt.\" Originally, it comes from a passage of the ancient text, The Book of Rites, from the chapter entitled Tan Gong II.

    "content": "When the other expressed his pity as he did, the man could have gone away. When he apologized, the man could have taken the food.'\"\nWhen the starving man refused to eat the 'poor man, come' food that Zengzi had offered, Zengzi used the same phrase from the Sun Tzu passage (wei yu), followed by: ¡§You're within your rights to turn down the offer when a man calls you 'poor man,' but it also would have been perfectly acceptable to eat the food after he apologizes.\" A commentator on the text named Zheng Xuan wrote: ¡§Wei is used in the same way as the word 'don't.' The intent of the passage is to tell the starving man not to speak so imprudently.\" The scholar Kong Yingda commented: ¡§Wei means 'do not.' Yu is merely an auxiliary word. The passage means: 'Starving people should not behave in such a way!'\"\nSo, wei yu means 'don't.' There are further examples of wei being used in this way, such as in Memorial to Yueyang Tower, by Fan Zhongyan. The relevant passage from Sun Tzu's The Art of War is typically translated as, ¡§Subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground\" actually means, 'War isn't a gentleman's duel; don't arrange with your enemy to set a time and place for the battle.'

The meaning is that you must always tread the line of the customary rules, staunchly follow the system of rules and follow enemy's situation closely; if there is any opportunity to exploit, advance and prepare to fight a decisive battle.\"\nBut, Jia Lin interprets it to mean that you shouldn't follow the rules: ¡§Here, the word 'tread' means 'to tread on.'

Advantageous conditions are what bring victory; you must not base all of your actions upon conforming to the rules.\"\nCao Cao comments: ¡§When treading the inked line, do not always act the same way.\" He doesn't say whether 'treading the inked line' means 'obey the rules' or 'disobey the rules.'

They explain it as referring to a situation where, after a battle, the general doesn't hand out rewards quickly enough, which leaves the soldiers wondering what they're supposed to do.

If that's your interpretation, you'll never really understand the art of war.

As the war reached its most intense phase, Xiang Yu trapped Liu Bang behind the walls of Xingyang city."

But his advisor, Chen Ping, had a plan - he told Liu Bang to take 40,000 jin of gold from his reserves and bribe some of the Chu generals. The idea was to spread division among the Chu ranks and create distance between Xiang Yu and his general, Zhong Limei, while also removing General Fan Zeng from Xiang Yu's inner circle. In the end, by making these strategic expenditures, Liu Bang was able to break out from Xiang Yu's siege. Years later, when Liu Bang was surrounded by the Xiongyu chieftain Modun's forces at Baideng, Chen Ping once again came forward with a plan: to offer a large bribe to Modun's wife and have her persuade Modun to let Liu Bang go. Xiang Yu and Liu Bang were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to the value they attached to spending money."

This is the best strategy, and it offers three benefits: first, by pivoting your army to a position undefended by the enemy, your forces cannot lose; second, by expanding the territory under your control you can recruit more soldiers; and third, the enemy Tang army will then, of its own accord, lift its siege of Wang Shichong's position.\"\nLing Jing's plan was a textbook application of standard operating procedures for 'contentious ground,' and it also embodied the strategy of relieving a besieged ally by attacking the besiegers in a different location.

Hence it is said: 'On them depends an army's ability to move.'\"\nLi Quan comments: ¡§Sun Tzu's treatise about war begins with calculations and ends with spies, for attacking is not the most important thing. How could those who would be generals not reflect upon this with the utmost care?\"\nThis comment from Li Quan serves well as a conclusion for this book. The essential core of Sun Tzu's way of thinking is expressed in just four words:\n¡§Win first, fight later.\"\nThe purpose of making calculations is to win before fighting, and to only raise an army once you're sure of victory. Likewise, the purpose of spies is also to win before fighting."

Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp. ¡§Hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies."

Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and doorkeepers and sentries of the general in command.

It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.

It's not some kind of secret scroll; it's a vessel for simple, ordinary principles, expressed in clear, sensible terms."

    "content": "As it turns out, simplicity has always been 'The Way of Sages.' The reason we can't become powerful, mighty beings is that we don't like the idea of ordinariness. We always make things so complicated, because we don't believe in simplicity. As my final summary of Sun Tzu's The Art of War, I have organized the core threads of his way of thinking into nine points:\n\n1) The art of war is about strength trumping weakness, not weakness trumping strength. The first chapter is about 'calculations,' not to be confused with 'ingenious strategems,' which is another possible translation of the root Chinese character ji (?)."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "It corresponds to the modern-day SWOT analytical framework: Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat. The idea of 'carrying out calculations in the temple' is about weighing and comparing both sides' political, economic and military strengths, while you're still safely at home, before you decide to go to war. There's also the framework of 'The five factors and the seven considerations,' which is a system for assigning scores to the various items up for comparison."
  },

    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Whichever side scores more points will win; whichever side scores fewer points will lose. Once you finish these evaluations, you'll know who's going to win. And then, once you know you can win, you can summon your officers, mobilize your army and go to war."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "If your calculations give you a score lower than your enemy's, don't fight. This is why Sun Tzu didn't believe in trying to beat strength with weakness -there's a low probability of a successful outcome. ¡§The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.\" Sun Tzu would never have bet the fate of his country's people on a low probability outcome. 2) Even if you can win a war, you still need to calculate the cost of victory."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Every action comes with a price, and the price of war is enormous. Don't think only about winning; you need to keep count of the costs you'll rack up along the way and decide whether it's worth it. Li Ke said; ¡§For Marquis Wen of Wei, many victories will lead to his certain ruin.\" You can win a lot of battles, and yet all those victories can lead to your country's destruction. This is because constant fighting leaves the people exhausted, while frequent victories tend to make lords arrogant."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "An arrogant lord leading an exhausted populace is a recipe for a failed state. The great Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty was a true example of this, as represented by his immortal words: ¡§Any who dare use force against Han will surely be brought to the executioner, no matter how far away they may be.\" The arrogance is breathtaking! Emperor Wu spent his life hacking away at the borders of his empire and expanding his territory, and for his efforts he won himself a glittering military record."

Both the government and the people of China were bankrupt, he drove the country to the brink of destruction, and in his later years he was forced under heavy political pressure from his government, and made to kneel and confess his guilt. This is what he said during his self-criticism: ¡§Since the time when I ascended the throne, I have engaged in many wanton acts, and have caused distress to all under heaven."

    "content": "It is now too late for regret. Starting from today, there will be a halt to all activities being detrimental to the common folk and squandering the resources of all under heaven.\"\n\n3) Win first, fight later. Sun Tzu's The Art of War is primarily about ways to strengthen yourself."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "First and foremost, you have to train and improve yourself instead of always thinking about other people and how to defeat them. Sun Tzu wrote: ¡§The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.\" He also wrote: ¡§One may know how to obtain victory without being able to achieve it,\" and ¡§Those who are skilled in war obtain victory first, and then fight.\" Don't look for victory on the battlefield; look for a battle after you've already won. Train and practice until you're strong."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Make yourself undefeatable, leave no chinks in your armor, and then wait until a chink appears in your enemy's armor. If the enemy isn't weaker than you, or if you're evenly matched - and if they don't make any mistakes, or leave any gaps in their defenses - you can't attack. ¡§The opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.\" In other words, victory comes the moment the enemy makes a mistake. If the enemy doesn't make a mistake, there's no way you can win. So, it's possible to judge and know ahead of time whether the outcome will be victory or defeat, but you can't make victory happen. As soon as the opportunity for victory appears, grab it and fight. You can't turn this formula around - if you charge into a fight casually, and look for a path to victory once the battle has already started, you're putting yourself in danger. 4) You have to be able to wait; patience is a necessity. These days, people often repeat the saying, 'If you don't go looking for death, you won't die.' The Art of War talks about this more than anything else."

When Wang Jian of Qin invaded Chu, he had the ability wait, and he also had the ability to sooth the nerves of the first Emperor of Qin and prevent him from becoming anxious. This enabled Wang Jian to lead a massive army of 600,000 soldiers into Chu territory, set up camp, and while away the days holding contests for his soldiers until finally the people of Chu grew anxious and began to move about, which opened up gaps in their defenses. Then, Wang Jian pounced and destroyed the state of Chu in a single move."

We talked about how the word 'irregular' is the correct translation of the root Chinese character, although it is often mistakenly interpreted to mean 'extraordinary.' It means 'irregular' in the mathematical sense of 'odd,' as in 'even numbers and odd numbers.' It's the part of the army that's left over or kept in reserve - the card you keep up your sleeve until the crucial moment, before finally pulling it out and securing victory.

Fancy maneuvers go wrong, and the only way to do things is by following the rules of combat and the lessons from the art of war. 7) The Way of Deception just isn't important. ¡§The art of war is the way of deception.\" These words are from Sun Tzu's The Art of War, and that misleads a lot of people. They might think that the art of war is about the same kind of thing as The Thirty-Six Stratagems - namely, the use of deception to win wars. But, if your opponent doesn't bite, you can use deception until you're blue in the face and it won't do you any good. The art of deception is not a major part of the.

In each case, I included the Chinese character because it would be impossible to clearly and fully convey the meaning of the ST without including them.

That is, the US didn't run away from the conflict in Iraq, because it is still very much mired in ongoing warfare there, with US troop combat deaths reported in the news. The aforementioned passage on page 485 needs to be corrected, and the two inaccurate pieces of this paragraph need to be corrected."
