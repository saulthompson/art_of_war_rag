The reading experience is designed to be like a personal helicopter ride, transporting you to the skies above ancient battlefields, with Sun Tzu himself sitting in the seat next to you, explaining in real time how each side is maneuvering their way through the battle, blow by blow. My personal background is in entrepreneurship, so some chapters contain brief discussions of lessons for corporate management and entrepreneurial competitiveness mixed in with the primary content."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "But, these are side-notes to the main historical narrative, and a part of my writing process of following where my thoughts take me. This book is not about looking at 'corporate warfare' through the lens of The Art of War. Rather, it is about really getting to the heart of Sun Tzu's masterwork as an ancient text, and understanding what it means in its original context. This book has been built on the shoulders of generations of Chinese scholars who have continued Sun Tzu's life's work by writing their own commentaries about The Art of War. Specifically, this book is based on the writings of 11 commentators who have forged a place in history, and whose work was first compiled in a Song dynasty (960-1279 CE) book, Eleven Commentaries on Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Each chapter in my book begins with a brief review of their work, before swiftly delving into a deeper analysis and discussion2."

    "content": "So, who are 'The Eleven Commentators?' If you want their names, they are Cao Cao, Meng Shi, Li Quan, Gu Lin, Du You, Du Mu, Chen Hao, Wang Xi, Mei Yaochen, He Shi and Zhang Yu. But who were they, really?"
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "The first to write a commentary on Sun Tzu's work was Cao Cao, who jotted the following musings about his contribution: Â¡Â§I have read many books about war and heard of many military strategies, and of all of these Sun Tzu's writings are the most profound. But it would be impossible for ordinary people to grasp the lessons within, and there is much that is superfluous, and so this text is unable to fulfill its purpose in the world."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "For this reason, I have written a commentary to elucidate its meaning.\"\nCao Cao spent a lifetime on the campaign trail during the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 CE). He is a giant figure in the annals of Chinese history, not only for his peerless military mind but also as a rare talent in the art of governance."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Because of his towering historical stature, his commentary has received the most serious attention, and I would assert that his is also the most accurate of all the commentaries. Large parts of this book follow Cao Cao's lead."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Sadly, Cao Cao was very sparing with his words, and what he did write is succinct to a fault. He even said that Sun Tzu was too wordy! After all, Cao Cao was a professional Â¡V a powerful warlord and a poet Â¡V and he was not writing for the benefit of ordinary people."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "As much as we might wish otherwise, he has left us even fewer words than Sun Tzu himself. About our second commentator, Meng Shi, not much is known regarding his real name, his place of birth, and most other details about his life. We don't even know for sure during which dynasty he lived, although it's possible he lived during the Liang dynasty of the Southern dynasties (420-589 CE) period."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Not much of his commentary is still with us today, but he did leave us some useful material to work with. Next up, Li Quan lived during the Tang dynasty, probably during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong (846-859 CE). He spent part of his life living as a religious hermit, practicing the Dao on Shaoshi Mountain near the Shaolin monastery."

  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",

  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "For instance, he said that Cao Cao's commentary was riddled with mistakes, and so he took it upon himself to write a new interpretation. Though I haven't managed to find any errors in Cao Cao's work, Li Quan's commentary is nonetheless very well written. The commentator Gu Lin lived during the Tang dynasty."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "During the reign of Emperor Dezong (779-805 CE) he served as an advisor to the military governor of Zhaoyi, a man named Li Baozhen. Li sent Gu Lin to bring a rebellious general, Wang Wujun, back in line, which he successfully did."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "As a result, he also managed to destroy Zhu Ci, another general who had rebelled and attempted to establish his own dynasty. Gu Lin was rewarded with noble titles: King of Wuwei Commandery, and Commander-General of the Shence Army. So, this commentator was himself a real military man, and perhaps because he was constantly busy fighting, his observations are short and succinct."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "We can only guess he didn't have much time for writing. Du You is a particularly special character. He served as prime minister of the Imperial court during the middle part of the Tang dynasty, and he lived through the catastrophic An-Shi rebellion that tore China apart."
  },

  },

  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "He compiled his research into an encyclopedic tome, known as The Tongdian. Unsurprisingly, Du You's commentary is hugely respected and is an authoritative source. Our next commentator, Du Mu, was Du You's grandson, and after Cao he was the most successful and influential of the reviewers. His output contains a large body of writings, many of which reference examples from various historical battles."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "In this book, I have used Du Mu's commentary more than any other. Du Mu was also an extremely famous poet of the Tang dynasty poetic elite, and memorizing his poems is still homework for students across China. Here's one of them:\n\nRaindrops pelt down on Qingming Festival,\nOn the road, miserable travellers' drooping heads\n\nMay I ask, where is the wine shop?"

  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "It's hard not to be a little arrogant when you're the scion of a wealthy noble house, and blessed with an outsized amount of talent on top of that. No matter how brilliantly Du Mu lectures on military theory, his manner can be overbearing."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "For example, a phrase that features regularly in his commentary is, 'Cao is mistaken!' This is invariably followed by Du Mu's own explanation of what he believe was actually happening. In any head-to-head comparison between Cao Cao and Du Mu, it would only be natural to trust Cao Cao more. He was, after all, the only one of the two who had actual experience leading troops into battle. But, this doesn't mean that Du Mu's different interpretations of things were entirely wrong."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Generally, when Du Mu says that Cao Cao's wrong about something, the two commentators were talking about different things. Du Mu was a better poet than Cao Cao, who also happened to be a famous poet in his own right."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "He was certainly very talented, but he couldn't necessarily understand what Cao Cao was talking about, since he had no battlefield experience and wasn't quite on the same level as Cao Cao academically. There is a Confucius quotation: 'Be always respectful, and you will never face humiliation.' This idea is also in the Confucian text, The Great Learning: Â¡Â§The ruler's words going forth contrary to right, will come back to him in the same way3.\" The idea is that if you bad-mouth someone, someone else will inevitably bad-mouth you."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Because Du Mu made a habit of saying that Cao Cao was wrong, another writer naturally went out of his way to tell the world that actually it was Du Mu who was wrong. That writer was Chen Hao, the next of our 11 commentators. Chen Hao thought that Du Mu had muddied the waters by discrediting Cao Cao at almost every turn, and so he felt compelled to set the account straight. The words 'Du Mu is wrong, Cao Cao is right' appear often in his commentary, part of his attempt to restore order to academic discussion of Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Chen Hao lived towards the end of the Tang dynasty, and his views about earlier commentators are summarized in historical records: Â¡Â§Chen Hao considered Lord Cao's commentary profound and cryptic, while he considered Du Mu's commentary broad and sweeping. Chen Hao wrote his commentary in order to moderate the gap between Cao and Du.\" Chen also respected the commentators who came before him as men of great wisdom, and made it his mission to carry their work forward. His thinking was: Sun Tzu has left us this remarkable book, but it's difficult for people to understand it through Cao Cao's commentary because it's just as brief and technical as the main text itself. On the other hand, he ventured, people might be misled by Du Mu's commentary, which although detailed and comprehensive is also undermined by sloppiness and even inaccuracies in some areas."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "So, Chen Hao decided to build on the foundation left by Cao Cao and Du Mu, and wrote a new commentary. Chinese historians have grouped together these three commentaries - by Cao Cao, Du Mu and Chen Hao - and given them a name: Commentaries of the Three Masters. By studying them together, students stand to gain deeper insight."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "Five of the 11 commentators lived during the Tang dynasty: Li Quan, Gu Lin, Du You, Du Mu and Chen Hao. This high concentration is because China became very unstable during the second half of the Tang dynasty, after the An-Shi rebellion."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "There was war almost every year, and so scholars were preoccupied with studying military theory much more than usual. This explains why Du Mu, whose grandfather had been a prime minister, became interested in military issues even while he was making a name for himself as a great poet. In this sense, he was very much a product of his times."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "After the Tang dynasty, the dynasty most preoccupied with military matters was the Song dynasty. It started with a period of relative peace, but then a series of events put the country under constant military pressure. There was constant tumult, from the Tangut rebellion, started by Li Yuanhao's declaration of a rival 'Western Xia' dynasty in the northwest, to conflicts with minority ethnic groups in the north. As problems piled up, the Song court was short on both competent generals and experienced troops."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Thirteen: The Use of Spies",
    "content": "What was to be done? Desperate, the dynasty's leaders turned to books in search of answers. The country devoted itself to studying the art of war, culminating in the government-compiled primer for military studies, called Seven Military Classics. The first of the seven classics was Sun Tzu's The Art of War, which is how it first became established as a classic text - thanks to the Song government. Against the backdrop of the Song dynasty's military problems, Wang Xi wrote a new commentary."

Although they were definitely wise, they and their writings belong to antiquity in many ways. I still had questions that I couldn't find a proper explanation for, so I began to search for commentaries by modern writers. There is no shortage of specialist commentaries about Sun Tzu's The Art of War, but most of them are concerned more with academic research than actual military studies. They are first and foremost works of scholarship, and they aren't concerned with war per se. When a writer writes about war, but is not motivated primarily by actual war, he ends up writing in a certain way, and about certain things - sometimes in a way that seems to actually move the discussion further away from the inherent subject matter. Eventually, I found a book titled, A Translation and Commentary of Sun Tzu's The Art of War4, written by Guo Huaruo and published by the Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House. This writer, Guo Huaruo, was a Lieutenant General in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China."

Someone else responds: 'At its core, it refers to the five factors, which are called: The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method; and Discipline.'

This is the idea that one should be cautious and not take risks; that one should be scared of the unknown, and always be alert and constantly scrutinizing not only yourself but also anything you may have overlooked or don't know about. At this point, I think we've made it pretty clear that the idea of not fighting battles is a major motif in The Art of War."

This partly explains why the only biographical information we have about Sun Tzu's life is very vague, while other generals of the same time period, like Wu Zixu, left many a fabulous tale behind. Consider these words: Â¡Â§Good fighters have neither a reputation for wisdom nor merit for courage, but excel in winning easy battles.\" When Sun Tzu wrote about 'victory,' he meant the kind of victory that is sealed in the temple while plans are being drawn, not the kind that's snatched from the enemy on the battlefield.

The only way to become a worthy Commander is to possess all five of these qualities and to use each only when appropriate.\"\nMei Yaochen said: Â¡Â§With wisdom, a man can formulate plans; with sincerity, a man can hand out both rewards and punishments; with benevolence, a man can maintain closeness with the people; with courage, a man can make decisions resolutely; with strictness, a man can establish his power.\"\nWang Xi said: Â¡Â§The wise man looks first, and feels no doubts, but is able to reflect, plan, and fully understand changes in the currents of politics; the sincere man is consistent in what he says and in the orders he gives to subordinates; the benevolent man is devoted to compassion, and thus gains people's hearts; the brave man defends what is right and has no fear, and is decisive and resolute; the strict man uses his prestige to rectify the hearts of the masses.

The word comes from the Qin convention of elevating a person by one grade within the hierarchy of nobility each time they cut off an enemy's head! This was a way of implanting the codes of reward and punishment into the very language people spoke - a person's head no longer just meant 'a person's head,' but 'one rank higher in the nobility.'

Only kings and the highest-ranking generals have total power to set rewards and punishments, but lower-ranked commanders still need to be able to lead troops into battle. Addressing this need, The United States Military Academy (also known as 'West Point,') makes a specific demand of its students, and it's about leadership skills: Always be mindful of other people's interests, and make sure they are aware that you are doing so.

To achieve this, the ruler must widely share the fruits of victory, govern the people with appropriate policies, and not be stingy in handing out rewards and noble titles. Commentators from different eras used the same historical example to illustrate this line from Sun Tzu's The Art of War: The general Han Xin's choice during the wars following the collapse of the Qin dynasty to fight for Liu Bang (who went on to become the first Emperor of the Han dynasty) instead of his rival warlord, Xiang Yu."

He carefully selected his best troops and equipment - 1,300 war chariots, 13,000 war horses, 50,000 foot soldiers brave enough to charge the enemy lines head-on, as well as 100,000 archers - and he marched to war. Li employed the stratagem of 'luring the enemy in deep,' first sending a large number of nomadic herders with accompanying livestock out into the countryside. The Xiongnu sent a small force to intercept the nomads and steal their livestock, and Li Mu allowed them to 'win,' intentionally losing several thousand men to the Xiongnu. The Xiongnu were elated by their little victory, and their chieftain, Chanyu, decided to launch a full invasion with a much larger force. As the Xiongnu advanced, Li Mu spread his troops wide in an ambush formation, surrounding the invaders on two sides. With one stroke, Li eliminated 100,000 Xiongnu cavalry. The Xiongnu chieftain fled into the wilderness, while the victorious Li Mu took full advantage of the momentum his victory gave him to attack and destroy two other nomadic tribal confederations, the Chanlan and the Dong Hu, while also subjugating the Lin Hu. For more than ten years after this battle, the Xiongnu didn't once come near the borders of Zhao."

Great generals are just like CEOs - the fundamentals of their work consist of operations management.

According to the story, after the dam was built, the water downriver was shallow enough for the enemy army to cross, but when they'd only crossed halfway, Han Xin had the sacks of earth torn down, effectively bursting the dam and drowning the enemy army. Zeng Guofan pointed out that it would be impossible to dam a large river just with a group of men throwing sacks of dirt in the water, and it would be even more impossible to instantly tear down such a dam.

Well, Sima Qian (a great historian of the Han dynasty) was after all a writer, too - there can be no doubt that some sensational and embellished sources must have figured in his research into the stories of Han Xin.\"\nThere aren't many stratagems, and they're all well-worn tools of the trade, familiar to commanders on either side of any conflict, all of whom have read the same military books.

Guan Yu was obsessed with capturing the Wei fortress of Fancheng, but at the same time he was wary of the potential threat posed by Eastern Wu. He feared that if he made moves to attack Fancheng, he would make himself vulnerable to attack from behind by Eastern Wu general Lu Meng. Because of this, Guan Yu left a large reserve force behind to defend Jingzhou. As for Cao Cao, he could see that Guan Yu was too powerful to fight, and was keen to stay away from him. Likewise, Lu Meng could see that Guan Yu held a strong position, and so spent his time making preparations. For Lu Meng to stand a chance of taking Jingzhou, he would have to make Guan Yu pull out his defensive forces. In other words, Jingzhou would have to pivot from a 'secure' situation to an 'exposed' one.

So, as far as the king was concerned, these rumors had been a great help; they even saved him the effort of working out which general to send out to replace Lian Po. Let's turn again to the wars between Liu Bang and Xiangyu following the collapse of the Qin dynasty. Liu Bang spent a year trapped by Xiang Yu in the city of Xinyang, cut off from outside help and supplies. Luckily, Liu Bang's advisor, Chen Ping, had a plan. He pointed out that Xiang Yu only had a handful of capable men giving him advice: Fan Zeng (whom Xiang Yu so respected that he called him his 'second father'), Zhong Limei, Long Qie and Zhou Yin. If a wedge could be driven between people in Xiang Yu's camp, these four men could be eliminated, and Xiang Yu would become much easier to deal with. Liu Bang gave Chen Ping 40,000 catties of gold, which he used to bribed a few of Xiang Yu's officers to spread rumors that Fan Zeng and Zhong Limei were dissatisfied that, despite doing more than anyone else for Xiang Yu, they hadn't got what they deserved: the title of 'king.'

One day, when a messenger from Xiang Yu visited Liu Bang's camp, Chen Ping ordered servants to lay out an exquisite spread of fine meats and wines for the messenger. He then asked the man: Â¡Â§What instructions from Lord Fan Zeng?\" The messenger, perplexed, responded: Â¡Â§I was sent by Xiang Yu, not Fan Zeng.\" Immediately, Chen Ping changed his tune. Â¡Â§Oh! We thought you'd been sent by Fan Zeng!\" he said, and ordered the servants to take away the fine meats and wines, and ushered the messenger into another, much less comfortable room, where he was served cheap tea and plain rice.

Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.\"\n\nAnalysis:\nTo start off the new chapter, Waging War, here's some commentary from Cao Cao: Â¡Â§If one desires to wage war, one must first calculate the expense, and determine whether grain can be seized from one's enemy.\"\nAnother comment, by Zhang Yu, addresses the logical order of steps to be taken: Â¡Â§The calculations being in order, prepare for war: calculate, in the following order, the costs of readying chariots and horses, procuring good equipment, and transporting grain and fodder.\" You need to have a budget. The 'swift chariots' Sun Tzu refers to were war chariots, each pulled by four horses."

    "content": "When Sun Tzu was alive, stirrups had not yet been invented, making it too precarious for men on horseback to fight at close quarters. This meant there were no horseback soldiers, only war chariots. Each war chariot would carry three armored soldiers, and was backed up by 72 foot soldiers following closely behind, according to The Methods of Sima. Ancient Chinese war chariots were used in more or less the same way as tanks in modern warfare. One war chariot represents 75 soldiers. In Chinese history books, a common phrase is 'a country of a thousand chariots,' which is actually a practical measure of a country's military might. In meant that the country in question possesses 1,000 war chariots, equaling 75,000 soldiers in total. Meanwhile, 'heavy chariots' refers to supply carts, which would be loaded with everything from food rations and cooking equipment to weapons, armor, clothes, etc. Each heavy chariot would carry 25 men: ten cooks, five attendants, five horse grooms, and five laborers whose job it was to chop wood and fetch water. With 1,000 heavy chariots, the number of extra men adds up to 25,000. Together with the men assigned to light chariots, this adds up to army of 100,000 men, also explaining the arithmetic behind 'a hundred thousand sets of armor.'\nThis is definitely a lot of men to account for, but then you have to wrap your head around somehow procuring 'provisions enough to carry them a thousand li!' Transporting food was a seriously important part of warfare in ancient China. For example, suppose you're planning an expedition to attack the Xiongnu."

One person who realized this revolutionary idea was Napoleon Bonaparte, and he used it to usher in a new era in military history - the age of the 'People's War.' The main cost-saver of the People's War was in reducing the price of a human life.

One picul equals ten dou, and since Zhang Yu explains in his commentary that one picul is also equal to 120 jin (a commonly used unit in China today, about 0.5 kilograms), we can see that one dou equals 12 jin. One zhong, according to Du Mu, is equal to six piculs and four dou, or 778 jin. Let's calculate the basis of Sun Tzu's statement: Â¡Â§One zhong of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own.\" Basically, you have to use 20 zhong of food in the process of having people transport one zhong of food to the front line.

Clearly, relying on human laborers and beasts of burden to transport food takes a long time, and it's very inefficient. There was similarly low efficiency in grain delivery when Han Wudi launched his conquest of the southwestern Yi people. He conscripted tens of thousands of people to run the transport convoys, and each picul of food delivered came at a cost of over a dozen zhong, an efficiency rate hovering near 1%. So, Sun Tzu's figure of 'one in twenty' was favourable in comparison."

On the ancient Chinese battlefield, it went without saying that your charioteers would try to pilfer the enemy's chariots, your cavalry would try to pilfer the enemy's cavalry, and your infantry would try to pilfer the enemy's infantry. When General Wu Qi did battle against a Qin army, he told his three armies: Â¡Â§Though we may destroy the enemy, any victory we might gain would be meritless unless our chariots take from their chariots, our cavalry take from their cavalry, and our infantry take from their infantry!\" This is one of the criteria for success in war; it's not enough just to kill the enemy and win the day.

As the army advanced, Yuwen Zhonghe holed up behind the walls of the city of Ying. Dugu Xin's strategy was to send his generals to the northeast corner of the city wall in the middle of the night with siege ladders, while he led a separate force to attack the southwest corner. By dawn, the city belonged to Dugu Xin, and Yuwen Zhonghe was his prisoner."

Cao Cao's commentary is simpler: Â¡Â§If attacking one with two, then use one part as your mainstay, and the other part as the auxiliary force.\" Cao Cao's interpretation of Sun Tzu is different; he reads it as an imperative to divide your own army.

So, Cao Cao was right too. Cao Cao went into more detail as well, spelling out how many troops should be allocated for different functions. This topic actually constitutes a whole branch of the art of war, known as 'the art of division.' A book by Ming dynasty strategist Liu Bowen, Extraordinary Strategies of a Hundred Battles, contains a chapter devoted to the art of division. Here's an excerpt:\nÂ¡Â§When fighting your enemy, if my forces are numerous and the enemy's few, then I ought to select an open expanse as the site where I will defeat him."

If my forces are three times more numerous than the enemy's, then I ought to allocate two thirds of my soldiers to be the main force, with the remaining one third as an auxiliary force. This can be called 'blocking him in the front with one half of my forces, while attacking his rear with the other half.' The past master10 says: 'if you do not divide when you ought to divide, you are tying your own hands.'\"\nCao Cao's Â¡Â§If attacking one with two, then use one part as your main force, and the other part as the auxiliary force\" could just as well be added to the text above. In this chapter, the concept of 'main forces and auxiliary forces' has repeatedly popped up. In fact, it comes from perhaps the most famous line (in China) of Sun Tzu's The Art of War: Â¡Â§Use the regular to engage the enemy, and the irregular to defeat him.\" Here, 'irregular' doesn't refer to anything strange or odd, despite the fact that the Chinese character used in the original text usually means 'extraordinary,' or even 'queer.' It simply means 'forces kept in reserve.' While the main forces get the fight started, the commander watches from his command center, waiting for the crucial moment. Then, he orders his reserves to spring into action, sealing his victory."

Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.\"\n\nAnalysis:\nÂ¡Â§If equally matched, we can offer battle.\" If your forces are evenly matched with the enemy's, it's important that you have the ability to fight. Cao Cao comments: Â¡Â§If the number of one's force are equivalent to the enemy's, then the skillful general lays an ambush with his irregular troops, and in this way secures victory.\" So, once again it comes back to a division of duties between 'regular and irregular troops.' The regular troops challenge the enemy head-on, while the irregular troops prepare an ambush. Though Cao Cao doesn't spell out here what proportion of troops should be allocated for 'regular' and 'irregular' roles, history tells us that in most cases when generals used this 'lure and ambush' tactic, the main force was actually smaller than the auxiliary force.

To illustrate his point, Du Mu cites the example set by Han dynasty general Zhou Yafu. When Zhou was stationed in Xiliu, the Emperor, Han Wendi, made an inspection tour of his forces, intending to show his appreciation to the soldiers. At every camp the Emperor visited, the gate guards let him pass as soon as they saw him, and the commanding officers rushed out to greet him. But Zhou Yafu's camp was different. When Han Wendi arrived, he was stopped by the guards and told to wait while someone went to inform Zhou Yajun that he'd arrived. The guards told the Emperor that they took orders from no one except their general, not even from the Son of Heaven. The Emperor waited for a good while before he was allowed in.

Â¡Â§He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign,\" and the general shall not be dictated to from afar by the ruler."

Zhang Yu also takes a shot at explaining the idea of 'formation.' He said the following: Â¡Â§It is the shape of two armies, one attacking and the other defending. When it is hidden within, then the enemy cannot determine what it is; when it is visible from outside, then the enemy can infiltrate through the cracks.\" \nBoth sides do all that they can to not allow the enemy to probe their formation."

So, 'formation' is a stage before a battle starts, while 'energy' is a topic for when battles have already gone live. The Han dynasty scholar-official Xun Yue wrote about 'formation' and 'energy' in the same passage:\nÂ¡Â§There are three essentials in the art of establishing policies and obtaining victory: 1) Formation; 2) Force; 3) Circumstances.

Finally, Xun Yue also mentioned 'circumstances.' When he talks about 'one's will,' he's referring to the commander-in-chief's willpower, but also to his men's morale, and whether or not it's 'in the realm of possibility.' In The Art of War, 'circumstances' are categorized as part of 'force,' so Xun Yue's 'three essentials' are actually only two: 'formation' and 'force.'\nOnce you've got your head around these two topics, the whole process of fighting and winning battles boils down to the two processes of 'winning formation' and 'winning force.' Now, let's start reading through Chapter Four: Formation, which is all about winning through the use of 'formations.'\n\nÂ¡Â§The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.

We generally run into problems when our focus is always on fighting, and not winning; when we want to use some clever idea to win quickly.

Sun Tzu said: Â¡Â§The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself. Thus, the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy. Hence the saying: One may know how to obtain victory without being able to achieve it. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.

In general, formation is about calculations of what may be gained and what may be lost."

    "content": "Energy is about that which is appropriate in the moment-to-moment situation of a battle, and it is about opportunities for advancing and retreating. Circumstances are about whether or not, in truth, one's will is within the realm of possibility. Thus, the fact that results differ even when policies and events are the same is because of differences in the use of these three arts.\"\nWhile this is an accurate analysis, Xun Yue is talking about a different kind of 'energy' than that described in Sun Tzu's The Art of War. Xun Yue understands 'energy' as being about responding to events as they develop, following whatever direction offers advantage. For Sun Tzu, 'energy' is something artificial, something that people can create, like a kind of 'momentum.'\nOnce you've built this momentum, you exploit it, using its artificial force to propel your team forward, or even to call upon the forces of nature to do your bidding. The main point that Sun Tzu emphasizes is building momentum as a way to influence people mentally, to exert force on their will. This is why, in The Art of War, the idea of 'circumstances'- which Xun Yue separates from 'formation' and 'force' - falls under the broader category of 'energy.' So, if you build the right kind of momentum, it doesn't matter what the circumstances are. Even if the people you're trying to influence don't have the will to do what you want, once you apply force to them, one way or another they'll have to do what you want!"

Fighting with a large army under your command is no different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals.\"\n\nManaging a lot of people is the same managing only a few, because of this idea of 'dividing up their numbers,' also known as 'staffing structure.'

The ancient word wu has become part of modern Chinese words, such as: duiwu, meaning 'a squad,' and 'ru dui,' meaning 'to join the military.'

Lin Biao named the smallest unit a small battle group. Three small battle groups made up a battle squad, three battle squads made up a war platoon, three war platoons made up a company, three companies made up a battalion, three battalions made up a regiment, and three regiments made up a division.

After the battle, Han Xin met with Lord Guangwu, and said: Â¡Â§If your lord had the sense to use your scheme, I would now be your prisoner.\" But Han Xin was just being polite; he never would have allowed himself to be taken prisoner, because if the Zhao army had decided to use Lord Guangwu's plan, he wouldn't have come.

At first light the next morning, Han Xin's army emerged from Jingxing Pass and arranged a force of 10,000 soldiers with their backs to the river. When the Zhao troops saw this, they laughed loudly. They'd never seen an army lined up like this before, and it seemed obvious that they'd be able to force their enemy into the water with a single charge. The Han troops were also aware of this possibility, and knew that, with their backs to the river and no way out, their only option was to fight to the death. This story is actually the origin of another modern Chinese idiom: 'To fight with one's back to the water.'\nHan Xin had already dispatched his auxiliary forces the night before.

The first part of his army to start fighting was the unit under his command, so this was the main force. The two other units - one with their backs to the river, and the other hiding in some undisclosed location, having set out the night before - were the two auxiliary forces."

    "content": "But if you ask the question again, once the battle's started, then yes, it absolutely was divided! The part of the army that charged out from the camp became the 'main force,' while the reserves that stayed behind became the 'auxiliary force.' For Han Xin, the next move would be to manipulate the Zhao army into committing all of its forces to the fight, emptying the Zhao camp. Meanwhile, a great battle was being fought between Han Xin's main-force unit and the Zhao army, and as it dragged on, the Zhao army's numerical superiority was beginning to show."

    "content": "Han Xin's men could no longer hold them back, so they began to retreat. It was not a dignified retreat; the battle flags, drums and ceremonial weapons were left scattered on the ground. But, this was actually designed to draw the enemy into attacking. Han Xin retreated back to his 10,000-strong riverside unit, which he then led in a frenzied counter-attack, knowing full well that this was to be a fight to the death. At this stage, Han Xin's army was no longer configured as two auxiliary forces and one regular, but had morphed into one main force and one irregular. His personal unit had merged with the force stationed by the river, becoming the new main force. The 2,000 men who'd snuck out of camp the night before had yet to appear, and were now waiting for the crucial moment when victory would be theirs to secure."

  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "Han Xin now had a good chance of winning. Why was that the case? The key was in the battle flags, drums and ceremonial weapons his men had dropped on the ground in the chaos of retreating. When the Zhao troops saw this happen, they reacted in two different ways. First, they thought that victory was already theirs; they concluded that Han Xin's army was crumbling before their eyes and had been forced back to the river."

Second, Han Xin's ceremonial props represented the spoils of war - the men who captured these items would be lavished with praise and glory, and this whetted the Zhao troops' appetite to be part of this moment and be recognized as heroes. They thought that victory was at hand, and that now was the time to call upon their auxiliary forces and win the day."

  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",

  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "This was exactly the moment he'd been waiting for. He now had a chance to win, so it was time to call on his 2,000 remaining men, who were laying in ambush nearby. As they charged toward the empty Zhao camp, each carried a red Han flag."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "They had one mission: to tear down the Zhao flag, and replace it with the Han flag. In this final stage, what kind of interchange was there between Han Xin's regular and auxiliary forces? The 2,000 irregular troops became the main force, because they were now on the offensive, while the part of Han Xin's army that was not on the offensive became the auxiliary force. With his main force attacking the enemy camp, the Zhao began to fall back, defeated."

    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",

Meanwhile, the main force now held the enemy camp, and their task was to not allow the retreating enemy troops back in. At this point, Han Xin's troops by the river switched roles and became his auxiliary force. The Zhao army realized something was wrong at their camp: they saw that it was full of red, their opponent's color."

  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "They'd lost the will to fight, and the whole army collapsed. In the end, Han Xin destroyed a 200,000-strong enemy force, killed Chen Yu and captured the Zhao king. In this battle, we've seen how the concepts of 'the regular and the irregular' are used. Han Xin was able to maintain separate regular and auxiliary forces through the whole battle, while the Zhao army ended up without an auxiliary force. If the Zhao leaders had kept 2,000 men in camp as reserves, Han Xin's 2,000-strong auxiliary force wouldn't have been able to get past them. But the sight of Han Xin's ceremonial weapons strewn on the ground was the Zhao irregulars' undoing."

Before the battle started, Han Xin had set up his army in one main force and two auxiliary forces."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "He personally commanded the main force, with one of the two auxiliary forces lined up with their backs to the river, and the other, consisting of 2,000 cavalry, laying in ambush. As the battle unfolded, Han Xin's army switched three times between regular and irregular. The first switch happened when the original main force feigned retreat, moving toward the auxiliary unit positioned by the river and merging with it."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "The newly combined Han force then engaged the enemy, making it the new main force. The second switch was when the Zhao forces attacked with all the troops they had, emptying their camp in the process. Then, Han Xin's auxiliary force of 2,000 cavalry charged into the deserted enemy camp and switched the flags, effectively becoming the new main force. Shortly after, the enemy gave up the fight with the Han men by the river, turned back and tried to retake their camp. At this point, the large riverside force under Han Xin's personal command suddenly switched roles and became the auxiliary force. In other words, they were no longer part of the main battle."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "All of this constitutes one switch between main and auxiliary. The third switch happened when the enemy troops were falling back in a panic, their chain of command having fallen apart. For Han Xin, the moment to seize victory had arrived."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "He mobilized what was now his auxiliary force and pounced on the retreating enemy, finally sealing his victory. So, now we can see that the main and auxiliary forces aren't drawn up neatly and settled ahead of time."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "Instead, they're subject to change at any moment as they cycle through an infinite loop, always complementing one another. Han Xin's great victory has served as an example of how an army is divided up into main and auxiliary forces, but these concepts don't only apply on the level of entire armies."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "There are also main and auxiliary forces at play on a much smaller level, like between individual squads and companies. In fact, every unit involved in a battle is wrapped up in 'the regular and the irregular.' From a micro perspective, 'the regular and the irregular' are the building blocks of battle tactics. They're why armies don't swarm forward like a hive of angry, disorganized bees, but instead work in regimented coordination, operating according to strict timing. This is the real reason why Sun Tzu said that the changes between 'the regular and the irregular' are truly infinite: you could never run out of new combinations. 'The regular and the irregular' are not only used by large armies."

    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "When Xiang Yu found himself making his last stand at the River Wu, with only 28 cavalry troops still by his side, he didn't charge the enemy in a single mass. He only had 28 men, but he still split them into two groups - one main and one auxiliary - that fought in tandem."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "In war, 'the regular and the irregular' is truly a fundamental principle. We can get a good understanding of how 'the regular and the irregular' are used by looking at a soccer match as an example. Whichever player has possession of the ball is 'the main force,' and any player who's making a run without the ball, in an effort to get in a good position, is an 'auxiliary force.' Whenever the ball is passed, the roles switch."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "Whoever receives the ball becomes the main force, while the player who has just passed becomes an auxiliary force. If 'the main force' attacks up the sideline and sees a gap in the opposition midfield, there's a chance to seize victory. The 'main force' kicks the ball into the penalty box, passing the baton to their teammate, who receives the ball and, taking the opposition by surprise, attacks where they are unprotected. This unleashes the auxiliary in the same moment that they switch roles and become the 'main force.' They shoot for victory, and the ball goes in the back of the net!"

    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "In battles, tactics basically boil down to either a balance between attacking and defending, or deploying in a flank-center-flank formation. But these are not what's most important. What's really crucial is how strong the coach's leadership abilities are, his strategic thinking abilities and tactical acumen, and the players' physical conditioning, skills, experience, training and cleverness. If you don't get these basics right, how is a 'surprise move' going to help you win?"

  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "There are only 11 players in a soccer team, but the 'regular and irregular' remain infinitely variable. After all, Xiang Yu divided his troops into main and auxiliary forces even when he only had 28 men left. Small and big armies alike divide into main and auxiliary forces, unless they want to lose. Even an army of a million soldiers can lose if it's not divided properly."

The Emperor of Former Qin, Fu Jian, marching at the head of a massive army of 800,000 to attack the state of Jin, lined his troops up in battle formation by Fei River. Meanwhile, his enemy, the Jin commander, Xie Xuan, had only 80,000 men. Xie Xuan sent a messenger to Fu Jian, to tell him to line his troops up by the river and make a little space by moving back, and that Xie Xuan would then cross the river with his army so they could get the fighting started. This way, they could get it over with as quickly as possible."

    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "He wanted to wipe them out before they ever got a chance to reach the far shore. On the face of it, this is a textbook strategy, completely watertight. So, what went wrong? Fu Jian's mistake was that he didn't split up his army into main and auxiliary forces. Retreating wouldn't have been a problem if he had left an auxiliary force in the wings. Then, if anything went wrong with the main force, or if Xie Xuan somehow made it to the shore and went on the attack, the auxiliary force would be able to deal him a direct hit, and he wouldn't have had any advantage. But Fu Jian was far too careless."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Five: Use of energy",
    "content": "He didn't really take Xie Xuan seriously. He thought that it'd be enough to just back up a little, get Xie Xuan to cross the water as quickly as possible, trap him in the middle of the river and finish him. He didn't see any need to set up main and auxiliary forces."

It was in his nature not to be suspicious of the people working for him, and even if he did have suspicions about a person, he'd still put them to work for him. Half of those he'd put in charge of his troops were like Zhu Xu: people with very different intentions than his own. Before the Battle of Fei River, Fu Jian sent Zhu Xu to try to persuade the Eastern Jin leader Xie Shi to surrender. This was Zhu Xu's big chance. When he met with Xie Shi, he told him that although it was claimed that the Former Qin army numbered 800,000 men, not all of them had yet been assembled. If the Eastern Jin forces attacked quickly and routed the Former Qin vanguard, they'd have a chance to defeat Fu Jian. It was because of this information from Zhu Xu that Xie Shi and Xie Xuan decided to make their move so quickly."

We're finished!\" At this point, the battle hadn't even started, but when the Qin soldiers saw the men in front of them falling back, and heard people behind them shouting that they'd been beaten, they panicked and ran for their lives. The Jin army crossed the river. Fu Rong jumped on his horse and galloped over to the retreating Qin forces, trying to stop them, but luck wasn't on his side.

In this instance, 'prompt' doesn't only mean being quick about doing something, but also minimizing the distance that has to be crossed when you act.

Thus, the general maintains all other units.\" \nThis means that if an army has nine parts, four parts make up the main force that's used to launch the first attack; another four parts make up the auxiliary force that forms the army's reserves and is deployed at the vital moment in order to seal victory; and the left-over ninth part is known as the 'fist.' This is the part that stays in a fixed position with the general, tightly within his grasp.

Show the enemy disorder where in reality there is order; show fear where there is courage, and weakness where there is strength. The reason why 'disorder comes from order' is that you must manage your army with both transparency and tight discipline if you're going to have any chance of effectively producing an illusion of chaos on the surface while still maintaining perfect order. The reason why 'fear comes from courage' is that it takes extraordinary courage to act scared enough to suck the enemy in.

For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height."

Meanwhile, Geng Yan marched his army towards Xi'an, and set up camp 40 li outside of the city. Studying the city's defenses, Geng saw that although Xi'an's walls were small, they were sturdy, and manned by experienced troops under the command of Zhang Lan. Linzi, on the other hand, though protected by high city walls, would be a much easier target to attack. So, Geng Yan made up his mind to attack Linzi instead. To do this, he had to convince the enemy that he was planning to attack Xi'an, so he used the same trick he'd used to such good effect before."

Then, he 'accidentally' let some captive enemy soldiers escape, so that they would go back to their commanders with news of his fake plans. When Zhang Lan heard, he began intensive preparations to ward off Geng Yan's coming attack. At midnight the day before Geng Yan had said he would attack Xi'an, he called his officers from their beds to eat with him, and announced that they would be marching straight for Linzi. The officers didn't come around immediately, and argued that they should attack Xi'an instead. But Geng Yan reasoned with them that Xi'an had strong walls, elite soldiers and watertight defenses, whereas Linzi was undefended. Geng Yan told them that the enemy would never expect them to suddenly show up at Linzi's city walls; with their enemies shell-shocked, they could take the city within a single day. Then, once Linzi had fallen, Xi'an would be within their reach."

He didn't try to save Anqing, but instead headed straight for the Prince of Ning's powerbase: the city of Nanchang.

As Cao Cao pondered the situation, drawing on the lessons of The Art of War, he determined that since he hadn't intended to fight a battle that day - and if he hadn't run into Zhao Yun, he would never have gone to his camp - it was possible that this was a plan made by Zhao Yun."

He personally commanded the main force, which was to act as a relief force for the vanguard, thus blocking Sima Yi's forward progress from a distance of several dozen li. Sima Yi used part of his army to pin down the enemy, and then quietly led an elite force around the enemy lines, across the River Liao, and directly to Gong Sunxiao's powerbase, the city of Rangping, which he then besieged. This is the stratagem of 'Forcing him to move by attacking a place where he is bound to come to the rescue; to leave him with no option but to fight, despite having strong defensive fortifications.' Gong Sunxiao was forced to move, to protect Rangping, and while on the road, he was defeated three times by Sima Yi's forces. He eventually retreated behind Rangping's city walls, where he took up a defensive position. This is what it means to 'surround an enemy position in order to destroy his relief force; know on what day and in what location the battle will be fought.'\nWhen Sima Yi arrived in Liaodong, it was the seventh month of the year - the beginning of the wet season.

What do you make of this problem?\"\nDuke Li of Wei replied: Â¡Â§To perceive weak points and strong, one must first understand 'the main and the auxiliary.' Most military leaders do not know how to use a main force as an auxiliary force and vice versa, so how could they properly identify when a strong point is a weak point, and a weak point is a strong point? The main and the auxiliary are used to manipulate the enemy's weak and strong points - where the enemy is strong, I must use my main force; where the enemy is weak, I must use my auxiliary force. Without an understanding of the usages of the main and the auxiliary, then even if one is able to perceive the enemy's weak and strong points, one will still be unable to attack them.\"\nThen, Emperor Taizong said: Â¡Â§When I use my auxiliary force as my main force, my enemy thinks that I am using my auxiliary force, when in fact it is my main force with which I am striking him. Or, the enemy thinks I am using my main force, when in fact it is my auxiliary force with which I am striking him. Thus, the enemy is in a constant position of weakness, while I am in a constant position of strength.\"\nThis passage ends with a summary by Duke Li of Wei: Â¡Â§Countless words have been written on this subject, but essentially, the message never ventures beyond this idea: 'Manipulate your foe, and do not allow yourself to be manipulated.'\"\nThe duke's summary forms a pair with the principle of winning by responding to your enemy's situation. When the idea of manipulating your foe while avoiding being manipulated yourself is taken to an extreme, it becomes: 'I don't care what your deal is; I only care what my deal is.'

Zhao She knew that this officer was a good man, but this was exactly what he'd been waiting for: a good man to come to him and offer his head on a platter. This was part of his plan to 'turn the circuitous into the direct.' So, he immediately ordered that the officer be taken outside and beheaded.

Meanwhile, the moment Zhao She had seen off the Qin spy, he ordered his army to pack up their armor, along with a few, light pieces of equipment and supplies, and he set off. Moving quickly, they arrived safely at Yuyu after two days and one night's march, without running into a single ambush or even the slightest whiff of resistance. Zhao She didn't head straight for Yuyu, but stopped about 50 li shy of the city, and set up camp in a location he'd selected specially for its good terrain. At this point, another of his officers, a man named Xu Li, stepped forward and put his neck on the line by suggesting to Zhao She: Â¡Â§Victory will surely belong to whoever holds the northern mountains.\" Zhao She immediately agreed with the man, and sent 10,000 troops to set up a position at the highest point in the northern mountains.

He immediately pulled his army back from Wu'an and rushed to protect the Qin position at Yuyu."
  },
  {
    "chapter": "Chapter Seven",
    "content": "But Zhao She already held the best terrain, so he won a major victory over the Qin army, resulting in the end of the Qin siege of Yuyu. The story of this battle is a particularly gripping one. Traveling unarmored, and with only light supplies, is a very dangerous move. After a forced march lasting two days and a night, without any supply wagons, the Zhao army had moved far away from its rear support system, and the soldiers would have been exhausted. If Zhao She had rushed straight into a confrontation with the Qin army under Yuyu's city walls, without pausing for a rest, he likely would have ended up as a Qin prisoner. Zhao She's stroke of genius lay in the fact that he camped 50 li outside of Yuyu, set up a proper defensive line and fortifications, and dug in, waiting for the Qin army to come to him. In doing this, he was putting into practice a key lesson from Weak Points and Strong: Â¡Â§Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will be exhausted.\" If one of the two sides was exhausted, it was definitely the Zhao troops - they would have been utterly spent after their forced march. But instead of heading straight for Yuyu, they pulled up 50 li short, meaning that the Qin soldiers basically had to run a marathon to get to them, wearing themselves out in the process. This turned the tables - the Zhao troops rested up while they waited for their enemies to tire themselves out on the road to the battlefield. Also in the chapter on Weak Points and Strong, we read how Duke Li of Wei said that in all the thousands of pages written about the art of war, there is nothing that isn't essentially saying: 'Manipulate your foe, and do not allow yourself to be manipulated.' At first, the Qin army had everything planned out. They thought they were manipulating Zhao She, because they'd set up strong, mutually reinforcing positions at Wu'an and Yuyu, and planned to use the stratagem of besieging a city with the main purpose of drawing in an enemy relief force, under Zhao She's command, and destroying it on the road."

In the story we looked at earlier of Wang Yangming putting down the Prince of Ning's rebellion, Wang Yangming really only had one card in his hand: attacking the city of Nanchang and waiting for the Prince of Ning to come to its rescue.

But actually, although Fu Jian's army did indeed number 800,000 troops in total, not all of them arrived in time. Many of his soldiers were still on the road when the battle started, and it's unclear in the historical records exactly how many made it to the battlefield on time. Xie Xuan had inside information, thanks to his secret ally, Zhu Xu, so he knew that Fu Jian hadn't yet assembled his whole army. That's the only reason Xie Xuan decided to launch a lightning-speed attack. In ancient Chinese warfare, armies would normally march 30 li, on average, per day. On forced marches, this speed would double, to 60 li per day."

Because it's nearly impossible to turn down such tempting bait, there are many more examples throughout history of using commanders-in-chief, and even Emperors, as bait.

All of these items would be highly valuable to the Zhao troops; whoever got hold of Han Xin's personal banner would be sure to receive rich rewards. And so, the entire Zhao army poured out of the gates of their camp, falling over themselves in their rush to grab the treasure and bite on Han Xin's hook. The Zhao army broke two of Sun Tzu's rules: 'Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight' and 'Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy.' Meanwhile, in front of the massed Zhao soldiers, Han Xin's unit retreated to the riverbank, joined forces with the 10,000 men he'd stationed there earlier, and then charged back towards the Zhao army.

The Qin men drew Zhao Kuo to the main Qin force's position at a place called Changbi, where they Qin army was waiting for them. The Qin commander was using principles from The Art of War: Â¡Â§Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will be exhausted,\" as well as Â¡Â§Knowing the time and place of the battle\" and Â¡Â§By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord.\" The Qin generals knew that the outcome of the battle would be decided at Changbi, so that's where they set themselves up to lure Zhao Kuo to them. Zhao Kuo was completely in the dark about this. Â¡Â§The Regular May Be Used for Joining Battle, but The irregular Will Be Needed in Order to Secure Victory.\"\n\nThe Qin army started the battle by using its 'bait troops' as their main (regular) force, while the main army stationed at Changbi served as the auxiliary (irregular) force.

But the Han official in command of Shangdang Commandery, Feng Ting, wasn't willing to take orders from the Qin authorities, so he decided to make his own offer. He announced that he was bequeathing Shangdang Commandery to the King of Zhao. The King of Zhao, being greedy by nature, was delighted, and immediately sent soldiers to occupy Shangdang. You could describe this move as 'stealing food from the tiger's mouth.'\nThere was no way the King of Qin would sit idly by after the King of Zhao had stolen his new land from under his nose, and he turned the Qin war machine toward Shangdang.

In ferocious pursuit, he and his army covered 200 li in a single day and night, fighting eight separate running battles as they went. After three days in which the Tang troops never once ate or took off their armor, the Tang generals finally called off the pursuit, announcing, Â¡Â§That will do.\" They let their troops rest for a while, and once everyone had been fed and re-gathered, they set off once more in pursuit. Li Shimin said: Â¡Â§I planned this all out long ago: we will keep chasing and keep fighting, and by the time it's over, we'll have crippled the enemy for good!\" The Tang forces kept up their pursuit, eventually pinning down Song Jingang's main force and annihilating them in a single fight.

Li Shimin used the same move he'd used before, once again following the principle of 'Do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.' After Li's generals begged him to allow them to attack the enemy, Li gave them a formal order: Â¡Â§Any man who dares speak of attacking shall be executed!\" The two armies faced off for over 60 days, at which point Xue Rengao ran out of food.

Â¡Â§It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide the army12 into two. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.\"\nIf you can win, go ahead and fight. If you can't win, then run.

If you march fifty li in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal. If you march thirty li with the same object, two thirds of your army will arrive. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost."

If the Prince of Ning had focused all his strength on taking the city of Anqing, the capital, Nanjing, would be within his grasp. Once he entered Nanjing, he'd have the political capital to declare himself Emperor, and once he'd done that, all the government officials and court politicians would be forced to choose a side. The Zhengde Emperor, who was in power at the time, was laughably unsuited to be the 'Son of Heaven,' so the Prince of Ning wasn't lacking for opportunity. Wang Yangming, taking advantage of the fact that the Prince of Ning's stronghold city, Nanchang, was undefended, marched in and took it, gambling that the Prince of Ning would withdraw his army and attempt to take back Nanchang. The Prince's advisors tried to reason with him until they were red in the face: Â¡Â§There are towns which must not be besieged!"

He never made it there - he was captured by Wang Yangming when he was only half-way back, at Poyang Lake. The Prince of Ning was inspired to launch his rebellion partly by the earlier success of Zhu Kang, who became Emperor Chengzu of the Ming dynasty. But Zhu Kang's strategy was precisely that 'there are towns which must not be besieged.' At the start of Zhu Kang's uprising, he spent a lot of time stuck in stalemate. He was mostly fighting in Hebei and Shandong Provinces, and although his army (the Yan army) won slightly more than they lost, he suffered heavy casualties, while the imperial army had a massive pool of manpower to call upon. If the imperial commanders could drag the conflict out, Zhu Kang would be unable to get the better of them. Later in the war, Zhu Kang got word from an imperial court eunuch in his service that Nanjing was poorly defended. So, he changed his whole strategy, drew up a large army, and personally led it directly to Nanjing. He fought his way to Yangzhou, at which point an imperial naval commander named Chen Xuan surrendered to Zhu Kang, handing him a fleet. He crossed the Yangzi River, made his way down to Zhenjiang, and then straight to Nanjing, where Zhu Hui, Prince of Gu, and Li Jinglong opened the Jinchuan gate and surrendered. Zhu Kang's rebellion had succeeded."

We can see this from the way that people explain and deconstruct the Chinese word for 'crisis' - weiji. Wei means 'danger,' and ji can mean 'opportunity.' So: crisis = danger + opportunity.

Lord Huang Shi, the immortal who according to legend presented the Han dynasty's General Zhang Lang with a copy of Jiang Ziya's Art of War, once said: Â¡Â§Brave men love to exercise their will, and foolish men care not if they die.\" Brave men like to do things their own way, and are typically unwilling to abandon their plans just because there might be some danger involved. If a man is both brave and foolish, he won't care about dying, which makes him blind to any danger that might threaten his life. Wu Qi once said that when ordinary people discuss what makes a general, they all agree that bravery comes before all else. But, in reality, bravery should only constitute a small part of a general's personality make-up."

In the attempt, Duke Xiang left us with a big, historical joke - the battle of the River Hong. With his ambition to become undisputed ruler of the known world, Duke Xiang decided to start with the easiest target: he went on the warpath against the feeble kingdom of Zheng. Zheng requested help from the kingdom of Chu, which immediately sent out an army to attack the kingdom of Song. Duke Xiang, seeing that he had a serious situation on his hands, called his armies back and dug in at a defensive position by the River Hong, where the Chu and Song armies eventually clashed. The Chu forces had yet to cross the river, but meanwhile, on the far side, the Song army was already deployed in battle formation. The Song Minister of War, Gong Sungu, tried to give Duke Xiang some advice: Â¡Â§The enemy's men are many, while we are few; we should strike when they are in the midst of crossing.\" But Duke Xiang didn't agree. Claiming that he was a 'benevolent' commander, he said: Â¡Â§I shall not impel the enemy to a perilous position, and I shall not force them into distress.\"\nSo, the Chu army crossed the river safely and began to deploy in battle formation. Again, Gong Sungu pled with Duke Xiang to take advantage of the enemy's temporary disorderliness and attack, but Duke Xiang wouldn't allow it."

He knew that he didn't have military power, but the way he saw it, 'benevolence' was what enabled Duke Huan of Qi to rule the world. And so, he felt, all he had to do was possess 'benevolence' and the world would raise him up and name him Undisputed Sovereign.

Thus, Dou will be enticed into crossing the river. Meanwhile, you will lay in ambush on the enemy's flank with several hundred elite warriors, and once half of the enemy forces have crossed, that is when you will strike.\"\nLuo Yi went along with the plan, and sure enough, Dou Jiande crossed. Luo Yi attacked precisely when half of the enemy troops had crossed, and inflicted a massive defeat. Zhang Yu comments: Â¡Â§If rebel soldiers move their forces across a waterway in order to join battle on the far side, you must not meet them at the water's edge. Wait until half of the enemy forces have crossed, and then move while their ranks are not yet settled and their head and tail detached; if you strike then, you are sure to be victorious.\"\n\nÂ¡Â§If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river he has to cross.\"\n\nIf you're looking to engage the enemy in combat, don't deploy your forces at the water's edge and think they'll come to you; they won't.

Conversely, if I do not wish to fight, then I must obstruct his passage across the water, so that it is impossible for him to cross.\"\nHowever, given that both sides understand this principle, it's actually used in reverse, as in the historical examples above. Guo Huai didn't want a fight with Liu Bei, and he knew exactly what to do: according to the art of war, if you don't want to fight, you should deploy at the river's edge so as to block the enemy from crossing. But Guo Huai knew that Liu Bei was familiar with this tactic, meaning that if he followed the art of war and lined up by the river, Liu Bei would recognize this as a sign that Guo Huai was weak, reluctant to fight, and would then do the exact opposite of what Guo Huai wanted, crossing the river and attacking. Then, there would be no guarantee that Guo Huai's limited battle capabilities would be able to hold off the enemy. But, if Guo Huai chose to form up at a distance from the river, then according to the art of war, Liu Bei should take this as a sign that Guo Huai had a powerful enough army to feel confident, that he wanted to fight, and that if Liu Bei tried to cross, Guo Huai would attack before all his forces reached the far side. So, Liu Bei decided he couldn't take the risk of attacking."

Yang Chufu wanted to make the Chu army cross the river, so he could attack while only half their army had crossed. He pulled his army back some way from the river and set up camp. Meanwhile, Zi Shang had the same idea: wanting to lure the Jin army across the river, he also pulled his army back and set up camp away from the river.

Mei Yaochen comments about 'precipitous cliffs with torrents running between' that are 'dangerously steep all around, with water rushing about.'\nCao Cao comments: Â¡Â§'Precipitous cliffs with torrents running between' refers to places of deep mountains and large waterways.\"\nBasically, it's about places with deep ravines with large waterways flowing through, which are impassable. About 'deep natural hollows,' Mei Yaochen says that these are Â¡Â§dangerously steep on four sides; places to which ravines and canyons lead.\"\nCao Cao identifies these places as having Â¡Â§high walls in all directions, with a hollow below in the center.\"\nDu Mu quotes from another ancient text, the Jun Shi: Â¡Â§Terrain characterized by cavities, where large waterways flow; such places are called 'heavenly wells.'\"\nThese places are deep holes with water at the bottom."

But although these places make for fun tourist destinations, they're much less fun for armies on the march in wartime. It's bad luck to have to take an army through such places."

If we engage our enemy near these types of terrain, the arrangement most favourable for us is for our army to be facing the dangerous terrain, while the enemy fights with their back to it. Cao Cao comments: Â¡Â§In war, we always stay far away from the six dangers, while causing the enemy to draw close to them and to face away from them; thus, I benefit and the enemy is in danger.\"\nDu Mu comments: Â¡Â§This passage tells us that, when encountering these six dangerous types of terrain, I should stay far away while facing the dangerous terrain, allowing me the freedom to advance and to halt as I will; the enemy should be made to draw near to the dangerous terrain and to face away from it, thus creating a barrier to his movements.

In what went down in history as 'The treaty ambush at Pingliang,' 500 or more Tang soldiers were killed, and another 1,000 or more were captured. In Chen Hao's commentary, he writes that when commanders from two states go on the attack, if neither side is showing any weakness, and yet one of them requests a peace treaty for no apparent reason, that means one of two things: (1) The enemy leaders are worried about some internal problem at home and, out of carelessness, have decided on a policy of peace for the time being; (2) They knew that it might be possible to try something, and they're trying to make you believe in yourself beyond doubt, and asking for peace now, while planning to launch a surprise attack later. Zhang Yu comments: Â¡Â§If the enemy requests peace for no reason, there is certainly some cunning plot in play.\" Once Liu Bang had already become Emperor Gaozu of the Han dynasty, he sent Li Yiji with a large cargo of treasures to visit with the Qin general Jia Shu and ask him to agree to peace terms. But they weren't even at war yet, so why would Gaozu send gifts and ask for peace?"

When the higher officers are angry and loose, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or not he is in a position to fight, the result is ruin. When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct; when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter disorganization. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be a rout. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post. The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.

One must unify the hearts and minds of the various ranks within one's army so that they become a single force, pull out one's intestines and splash one's blood, charge forward toward death, glory in defeat, and transform disaster into a great good fortune.\"\n\nDuke Li's discourse on 'desperate ground' can be divided into commentaries about seven distinct situations:\n\n1) Â¡Â§Perhaps one has advanced with one's forces and, lacking a guide, plunges into danger and defeat and becomes constrained by the enemy.\"\n\nYou didn't bother finding a local person to guide you as you moved your army forward. You plunged blindly ahead, got lost, and found yourself in a deep hole, in danger and at the mercy of the enemy."

The first point Duke Li makes is the vital importance of studying the maps and being totally clear about the lay of the land. Also, you absolutely must use a guide while on the march, because this is the only way to avoid trapping yourself in 'desperate ground.' Throughout Chinese history, renowned generals have always memorized maps inside out, and made a point of studying maps whenever they had a spare moment. When Liu Bang came through the mountain pass as a conqueror into the land of Qin, he didn't steal the beautiful women or the riches of Qin."

All they have to do is crowd you, and your whole army will plunge into the void. 3) Â¡Â§The way is blocked ahead and behind, rocks and cliffs over which one passes like a column of wild geese or fish on a line.\"\n\nThere's no road open to you either ahead or behind. All you can do is move single-file along the edge of steep cliffs. 4) Â¡Â§One's battle lines are disorganized; if the enemy comes at speed and in strength, there is no solid ground for one to advance or retreat upon.\"\n\nYou've only just arrived at the battlefield, you haven't had a chance to organize your battle lines, you haven't built any defensive structures, you haven't had time to form up your soldiers, and already the enemy is charging towards you.

In fact, Du Mu was saying that if the enemy has gotten ahead of you, you should chase after him, and try to get ahead, so you can be the first to arrive at the contentious ground. Du Mu was not saying that in this scenario the enemy has already occupied the contentious ground. Chen Hao's comment argues that if the favourable terrain is ahead of you, you should send a small unit of elite soldiers to occupy it. Then, if the enemy attacks their position in force, you can send your main army to attack them from behind."

    "chapter": "Chapter Eleven: The Nine Situations",
    "content": "Chen Hao seems once again to have put too much of his own thinking into his comment. With contentious ground, if you get hold of it, it's yours, and that's all. Sun Tzu probably wasn't saying that after you've taken the contentious ground you should come up behind the enemy and strike their rear. Du You comments: Â¡Â§With favourable terrain ahead, one should enter into it from behind. On contentious ground, victory belongs to whoever occupies it first, and defeat falls to whoever fails to do so. Therefore, bring your rear units close after the remainder of your forces so that the different parts of your army remain connected.\" The first part of what Du You said was right - the nature of contentious ground is that whoever occupies it first will win, and the other side will lose. That's exactly why it's called 'contentious ground.' This makes what you do after you hold the contentious ground, or whether you should hit the enemy with a sneak attack from behind, a moot point. But, the second part of Du You's comment - Â¡Â§Therefore, bring your rear units close after the remainder of your forces so that the different parts of your army are connected\" - shows that he also didn't understand the original text. Does he want the rear units to catch up and link together with the forward units so that the army doesn't fall apart? Zhang Yu doubles down on Du You's view: Â¡Â§In contentious ground speed is a commodity of the highest value; it is not acceptable for your forward units to move quickly ahead while your rear units fail to keep up. Therefore, you should quickly move your rear units forward so that the head and tail of your army arrive together.\" So, Zhang Yu is interpreting the 'rear' from Sun Tzu's original text to mean not the enemy's rear, but your own rear. He's saying you shouldn't get yourself in a situation where your forward units make it to the contentious ground, but your rear units can't keep up."

The character qi refers to a location to which the enemy is attached for the advantages it offers; the general must occupy this location, and so he must secretly travel there so as not to make the enemy aware.\"\nDu Mu's interpretation of 'subtly,' as referring to concealment, makes perfect sense.

But, what connection is there between Cao Cao's comment - 'setting out after the enemy but arriving before him' - and 'subtly contrive?\" The commentators argue that 'subtly' is about casually leaking information to the enemy.

After further investigation, I found that the words conventionally translated as 'subtly contrive' (wei yu) actually mean 'don't do it this way.' There's a well-known phrase in Chinese, 'Poor man come; here's food,' which means food that is donated with contempt.\" Originally, it comes from a passage of the ancient text, The Book of Rites, from the chapter entitled Tan Gong II. This is the relevant passage:\nÂ¡Â§During a great famine in Qi, Qian Ao had food prepared on the roads, to wait the approach of hungry people and give to them."

Qian Ao, carrying with his left hand some rice, and holding some drink with the other, said to him, 'Poor man! Come and eat.' The man, opening his eyes with a stare, and looking at him, said, 'It was because I would not eat (when told) 'Poor man come; here's food,' that I am come to this state.' Qian Ao immediately apologized for his words, but the man would not take the food and died. When Zengzi heard the circumstances, he said, 'Do not behave like this!"

    "content": "When the other expressed his pity as he did, the man could have gone away. When he apologized, the man could have taken the food.'\"\nWhen the starving man refused to eat the 'poor man, come' food that Zengzi had offered, Zengzi used the same phrase from the Sun Tzu passage (wei yu), followed by: Â¡Â§You're within your rights to turn down the offer when a man calls you 'poor man,' but it also would have been perfectly acceptable to eat the food after he apologizes.\" A commentator on the text named Zheng Xuan wrote: Â¡Â§Wei is used in the same way as the word 'don't.' The intent of the passage is to tell the starving man not to speak so imprudently.\" The scholar Kong Yingda commented: Â¡Â§Wei means 'do not.' Yu is merely an auxiliary word. The passage means: 'Starving people should not behave in such a way!'\"\nSo, wei yu means 'don't.' There are further examples of wei being used in this way, such as in Memorial to Yueyang Tower, by Fan Zhongyan. The relevant passage from Sun Tzu's The Art of War is typically translated as, Â¡Â§Subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground\" actually means, 'War isn't a gentleman's duel; don't arrange with your enemy to set a time and place for the battle.'

The 'inked line' means 'convention' or 'customary rules.' When a carpenter needs to cut wood to make a piece of furniture, the first thing he does is draw an inked line on the wood, which he then cuts along.

So, it would also be correct to interpret it as meaning 'don't follow the rules.' \nDu Mu says that it means you should follow the customary rules: Â¡Â§The word 'ink' here refers to 'customary rules.' The meaning is that you must always tread the line of the customary rules, staunchly follow the system of rules and follow enemy's situation closely; if there is any opportunity to exploit, advance and prepare to fight a decisive battle.\"\nBut, Jia Lin interprets it to mean that you shouldn't follow the rules: Â¡Â§Here, the word 'tread' means 'to tread on.' The word 'ink' means 'rules.' Follow closely the enemy's plans in order to engage in a decisive battle and accomplish your task. Advantageous conditions are what bring victory; you must not base all of your actions upon conforming to the rules.\"\nCao Cao comments: Â¡Â§When treading the inked line, do not always act the same way.\" He doesn't say whether 'treading the inked line' means 'obey the rules' or 'disobey the rules.'

Marquess Wen of Wei once said to Li Ke: Â¡Â§Why was the state of Wu destroyed?\" Li Ke replied: Â¡Â§Because Wu fought many battles and won many victories.\" Marquess Wen said: Â¡Â§It is a blessing for a country to fight many battles and win many victories. So why was the state of Wu defeated?\" Li Ke told him: Â¡Â§Many battles make the people poor; many victories make the lord arrogant. The state of Wu was destroyed because an arrogant lord ruled over an impoverished people.\"\nThe strategist Wu Qi had a similar understanding:\nÂ¡Â§Attacking and winning is easy, maintaining one's victorious position is difficult. Hence it is said: 'Among all the warring states of the world, those who win five victories suffer great catastrophe, those who win four victories face many problems, those who win three victories become regional hegemons, those who win two victories become king, those who win one victory become Emperor.' Hence, rare are those states who conquer the world by winning many victories, yet many such states suffer destruction.\"\nXiang Yu fought and won dozens of battles, while his rival Liu Bang only won a single battle, at Gaixia. Attacking and winning is easy; maintaining one's victorious position is difficult."

The border fort commanders all had sons living in Zhao captivity as hostages, so Zu Ti made exceptions for them and let them maintain good relations on both sides of the border. He treated them with special courtesy and got them to provide him with intelligence from contacts in Later Zhao. Occasionally, he would launch a pretend attack against one of the Jin forts to show the Later Zhao authorities that the garrisons had nothing to do with him.

Fuchai of Wu had surrounded Gou Jian of Yue and 5,000 exhausted Yue troops, remnants of a defeated army, at Huiji Mountain. Yue's destruction seemed imminent. At the time, there were three high-ranking advisors in King Fuchai's entourage: Wu Zixu, Sun Tzu and Bo Pi. Gou Jian sent a messenger to tell King Fuchai that he wanted to surrender, but Wu Zixu urged Fuchai not to give Gou Jian any chances. He advised destroying Yue outright. Meanwhile, Gou Jian sent a man named Wen Zhong to bribe Bo Pi with gold and beautiful women, and to tell him that, despite appearances suggesting that Yue was surrendering to King Fuchai, the real surrender was actually being offered to him, Bo Pi. Wen Zhong also told Bo Pi that, from then on, any time gold, silks or women were sent to the Wu king, Bo Pi would get the first pick. The wealth of Yue was to be at Bo Pi's disposal."

Again, it was Bo Pi who later persuaded Fuchai to release Gou Jian and give him safe passage back home to Yue. And, it was through Bo Pi that Gou Jian sent two famously beautiful women, Xi Shi and Zheng Dan, as gifts to Fuchai. It was also Bo Pi who caused Fuchai to squander his people's energy and his kingdom's riches by not only suggesting that he rebuild the Gusu Tower, but also arranging for the finest Yue timber to be made available for the job.

This filled him with secret guilt; he felt uneasy and suspected that any of his men could betray him and go over to Liu Bang. Suspicion always comes down to self-doubt.

When they're sent out on a mission, their own side has already sold them out. What defines a 'doomed spy?' They're envoys or agents to whom you hand false information and order to pass it on to the enemy.

A senior official named Guan Qisi said: Â¡Â§The state of Hu is an appropriate target.\" It was a good judgment call, but tragically, he didn't know that the reason his lord had asked this question was that he wanted a 'doomed spy.' By being the first to put his hand up, Guan Qisi had unwittingly volunteered for the role.

I have my suspicions that that a phrase coined by Lao Tzu - 'Governing a large state is like cooking tiny delicacies' - might have been inspired by Yi Zhi.

This time, it was Jiang Ziya, a man from Yin Shang who was pivotal to the rise of the Zhou Dynasty. Jiang Ziya once worked for King Zhou of Shang, and when he came into the service of King Wen of Zhou, he brought with him a huge amount of insider knowledge about the Shang royal court. Over the millennia since Sun Tzu's The Art of War was written, many scholars have struggled to understand why he cited these two men, Yi Zhi and Jiang Ziya, as examples of spies. Some have even been downright disgruntled about it. This is because the majority of people who read, or write commentary about, The Art of War are bookish types, generally with a Confucianist bent. Within the Confucian tradition, both Yi Zhi and Jiang Ziya are venerated as sages and models of Confucian values, and the fact that Sun Tzu describes them as spies doesn't sit well with those values. Spies might be important, but in the framework of Confucianism, a true gentleman of noble character would never consider doing the kind of things that are routine tasks in spy work. On top of that, both Yi Zhi and Jiang Ziya played crucial roles in the founding of a new dynasty."

If the enemy doesn't make a mistake, there's no way you can win. So, it's possible to judge and know ahead of time whether the outcome will be victory or defeat, but you can't make victory happen. As soon as the opportunity for victory appears, grab it and fight. You can't turn this formula around - if you charge into a fight casually, and look for a path to victory once the battle has already started, you're putting yourself in danger. 4) You have to be able to wait; patience is a necessity.

But although he had the ability to wait, Emperor Xuanzong didn't - the anxious Emperor forced Shuge Han to leave the safety of the pass and start a fight, which led to the total destruction of his army. When Wang Jian of Qin invaded Chu, he had the ability wait, and he also had the ability to sooth the nerves of the first Emperor of Qin and prevent him from becoming anxious. This enabled Wang Jian to lead a massive army of 600,000 soldiers into Chu territory, set up camp, and while away the days holding contests for his soldiers until finally the people of Chu grew anxious and began to move about, which opened up gaps in their defenses. Then, Wang Jian pounced and destroyed the state of Chu in a single move."

In the end, he outlived his rivals and his road to total power came unblocked. Even so, he bided his time for another 17 years after Toyotomi Hideyoshi's death before steadily taking control of all Japan. After him, his descendants ruled over Japan for more than 200 years."

That's how you defeat your enemy and make yourself stronger at the same time. Sun Tzu's way of thinking has a strong emphasis on preservation - self-preservation, preservation of the people, preservation of cities, preservation of wealth and, ideally, preservation of enemy subjects so that you can bring them over to work for you. Only by doing all these things can you create universal stability."

It's the part of the army that's left over or kept in reserve - the card you keep up your sleeve until the crucial moment, before finally pulling it out and securing victory.

Fancy maneuvers go wrong, and the only way to do things is by following the rules of combat and the lessons from the art of war. 7) The Way of Deception just isn't important. Â¡Â§The art of war is the way of deception.\" These words are from Sun Tzu's The Art of War, and that misleads a lot of people. They might think that the art of war is about the same kind of thing as The Thirty-Six Stratagems - namely, the use of deception to win wars. But, if your opponent doesn't bite, you can use deception until you're blue in the face and it won't do you any good. The art of deception is not a major part of the.

That is, the US didn't run away from the conflict in Iraq, because it is still very much mired in ongoing warfare there, with US troop combat deaths reported in the news. The aforementioned passage on page 485 needs to be corrected, and the two inaccurate pieces of this paragraph need to be corrected."
